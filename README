This is my personal repo, where I keep ~random~ things.

Feel free to copy any of these, or even clone the repo and use them directly,
but I make no promise of updates. They should build, though.

Each package contains a `manifest` file in addition to the usual required files.
This allows you to search through packages which aren't installed to find which
provides a certain file, for example.

The kiss-find package may be of interest to you; it uses a database generated
in my repo at https://github.com/aabacchus/kiss-find and is the only version
around which currently works, as far as I can tell.
