.INDENT 3.5
\fBabcm2ps\fP [global_options] ABC_file [file_options] ...
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
\fBabcm2ps\fP translates tunes written in
the ABC music notation format to customary sheet music scores in
PostScript or SVG. It is based on \fBabc2ps\fP 1.2.5 and was
developed mainly to print Baroque organ scores that have
independent voices played on multiple keyboards and a
pedal\-board. The program has since been extended to support
various other notation conventions in use for sheet music.
.sp
Options given immediately after the command name apply to
the run as a whole; options given after an ABC file name apply
to that file.
.sp
Formatting parameters can also be set in "format files" and
in the ABC files themselves.
.SH OPTIONS
.sp
The list of the command line options may be known running:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5

.sp
The options may be grouped when they have no argument, but the
last one (ex: \fB\-lnGI20\fP).
.sp
The options may be disabled when starting with \(aq+\(aq or ending with \(aq\-\(aq
(ex: \fB+MT1\fP is the same as \fB\-MT1\-\fP).
.sp
The general output format is the last found in the command line.

.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-e [ <tune index list> ] [ <regular expression> ]
Select which tunes from an ABC file to print.
.sp
<tune index list> is either a comma\-separated list of tune
numbers (as per the \fBX:\fP header), or a regular expression
which will be matched against the tune headers as a whole.
The \fB\-e\fP option must occur after an ABC file
name and applies to that file.
.sp
Ranges of tune numbers may be specified like \fB<t1>\-<t2>\fP;
<t2> may be omitted which means
"all remaining tunes until the end of file". Note that
filtering may cause problems, e.g., with global (non\-tune)
definitions in the ABC file.
.sp
This corresponds to the \fB%%select\fP formatting parameter.
.UNINDENT

Insert a red cercle around the errors in the PostScript output.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-j <int>[b], +j
Output a measure number every <int> measures.
.sp
If <int> is 0, the measure number appears at the left of each staff.
The trailing \fBb\fP causes a box to be drawn
around each measure number (default: no measure numbering).
.sp
This corresponds to the \fB%%measurenb\fP formatting parameter.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.BI \-k \ <int>
Set the size of the PostScript output buffer in Kibytes.

.B Definition of the staff system
By default, each voice goes on its own
staff. The \fB%%staves <definition>\fP
pseudo\-comment can be used to control staff
assignment. The <definition>
consists of voice names (from \fBV:\fP) and pairs of
parentheses, braces or brackets.
.INDENT 7.0
.IP \(bu 2
When a voice name is not within a pair of
special characters, it goes on a separate staff.
.IP \(bu 2
For voice names enclosed in brackets, a bracket
is displayed at the beginning of each line that joins
the staves of the voices in question.
.IP \(bu 2
For voice names enclosed in braces, all the
voices go on two staves (keyboard score). There can be
at most four voices between a single pair of braces.
.IP \(bu 2
For voice names enclosed in parentheses, all the
voices appear on a single staff.
.UNINDENT
.sp
The \fB|\fP character prevents measure bars from
being drawn between two staves.
If \fB%%staves\fP occurs in a tune, all the
voices not mentioned will not be output at all.
.sp
The \fB%%score\fP directive occurs in the ABC
draft 2.0 standard and is similar to
the \fB%%staves\fP specification described
above. The rules are:
.INDENT 7.0
.IP \(bu 2
Voice names within parentheses form a "voice
group" and go on a single staff. A voice name that is
not within parentheses forms its own voice group and
goes on a staff by itself.
.IP \(bu 2
Voice groups within braces form a "voice block"
and are preceded by a big brace in the output. This is
especially useful for keyboard music.
.IP \(bu 2
Voice groups or voice blocks within brackets
form a "voice block" and will be preceded by a big
bracket in the output.
.IP \(bu 2
If a \fB|\fP character occurs between two
voice groups or voice blocks, the bar lines in all of
the associated staves will be continuous.
.IP \(bu 2
A single voice surrounded by two voice groups
can be preceded by an asterisk to make it into a
"floating" voice. This means that, for each note of the
voice, a separate decision is made whether it is printed
on the preceding or the following voice group\(aqs staff.
.IP \(bu 2
Voices that appear in the tune body but not in
the \fB%%score\fP directive will not be output at
all. If there is no \fB%%score\fP directive, each
voice will be output on its own staff.
.IP \(bu 2
A \fB%%score\fP directive inside a tune
resets the mechanism so voices can be removed or added.
.UNINDENT
.TP
.B Voice overlay
You can add notes to a staff without introducing a
complete extra voice by using the ampersand
(\fB&\fP).  A single measure can be split into two voices like:
.INDENT 7.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
|F2A2Bc&F2c2bc|
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
The \fB(&...&...&)\fP construction allows splitting multiple
measures:
.INDENT 7.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
|!f!(&GG<G|GG F=E| E2  E(_D/E)|_D D  C      D |C4\- |C
   &DC<C|CC_D C|=B,2_B,B,   |_A,A,(G,/A,/)B,|F,4\-|F,&)zzD=E|
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
A double ampersand (\fB&&\fP) will allow
overlaying more than two lines of music but this feature has
not yet been implemented.
.TP
.B Lyrics
Aligned lyrics under a staff are written as a
\fBw:\fP line directly below the staff line. For example:
.INDENT 7.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
edc2 edc2|
w:Three blind mice, three blind mice
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Each word in the \fBw:\fP line (delimited by
blanks) is associated with one note, in sequence. The
following special symbols modify this behaviour:
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
.B \fB*\fP
Skips one note.
.TP
.B \fB\-\fP
Splits a word into two syllables which are
associated with two adjacent notes. A "\-" is drawn
between them.
.TP
.B \fB|\fP
Advances to the next bar line.
.TP
.B \fB~\fP
Is output as a space, but unites two words so
they appear under a single note.
.TP
.B \fB_\fP
Draws a thin underscore from the previous note
to the next.
.UNINDENT
.sp
To include more than one line of lyrics, use
multiple \fBw:\fP lines. To include hyphens without
splitting a word over multiple notes,
use \fB\e\-\fP\&.
.sp
If a word starts with a digit, this is interpreted as a
stanza number and outdented a bit to the left.
.TP
.B Slurs and ties
The direction of slurs and ties may be controlled using
the "(," / "(\(aq" and "\-," / "\-\(aq" constructions.
.TP
.B Microtone pitches
Microtone pitches are indicated by a fraction after an
accidental, as in \fB^3/4c\fP\&. When omitted, the
numerator defaultes to 1 and the denominator to 2
(so \fB^/c\fP is the same as \fB^1/2c\fP). The
numerator and denominator values may not exceed 256. There
is built\-in support for quarter\-tone accidentals (1/2 and
3/2 sharps and flats); for other values, rendering functions
must be defined using \fB%%postscript\fP\&.
.TP
.B EPS inclusion
EPS files may be included inside tunes using the
pseudo\-comment \fB%%EPS <file>\fP\&.
