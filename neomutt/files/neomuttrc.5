.SH NAME
.\" --------------------------------------------------------------------
neomuttrc \- Configuration file for the NeoMutt Mail User Agent (MUA)
.
.\" --------------------------------------------------------------------
.SH DESCRIPTION
.\" --------------------------------------------------------------------
.PP
A NeoMutt configuration file consists of a series of \(lqcommands\(rq. Each
line of the file may contain one or more commands. When multiple commands are
used, they must be separated by a semicolon (\(lq\fB;\fP\(rq).
.
.PP
The hash mark, or pound sign (\(lq\fB#\fP\(rq), is used as a \(lqcomment\(rq
character. You can use it to annotate your initialization file. All text after
the comment character to the end of the line is ignored.
.
.PP
Single quotes (\(lq\fB\(aq\fP\(rq) and double quotes (\(lq\fB\(dq\fP\(rq) can
be used to quote strings which contain spaces or other special characters. The
difference between the two types of quotes is similar to that of many popular
shell programs, namely that a single quote is used to specify a literal string
(one that is not interpreted for shell variables or quoting with a backslash
[see next paragraph]), while double quotes indicate a string which should be
evaluated. For example, backticks are evaluated inside of double quotes, but
not single quotes.
.
.PP
\(lq\fB\(rs\fP\(rq quotes the next character, just as in shells such as Bash
and Zsh. For example, if you want to put quotes (\(lq\fB\(dq\fP\(rq) inside of
a string, you can use \(lq\fB\(rs\fP\(rq to force the next character to be
a literal instead of interpreted character.
.
.PP
\(lq\fB\(rs\(rs\fP\(rq means to insert a literal \(lq\fB\(rs\fP\(rq into the
line. \(lq\fB\(rsn\fP\(rq and \(lq\fB\(rsr\fP\(rq have their usual C meanings
of line feed (LF) and carriage return (CR), respectively.
.
.PP
A \(lq\fB\(rs\fP\(rq at the end of a line can be used to split commands over
multiple lines, provided that the split points don't appear in the middle of
command names.
.
.PP
It is also possible to substitute the output of a Unix command in an
initialization file. This is accomplished by enclosing the command in backticks
(\fB\(ga\fP\fIcommand\fP\fB\(ga\fP).
.
.PP
Unix environment variables can be accessed like the way it is done in shells
like sh and Bash: Prepend the name of the variable by a dollar
(\(lq\fB\(Do\fP\(rq) sign.

.PP
The following are the commands understood by NeoMutt:
.
.PP
.nf
\fBaccount-hook\fP \fIregex\fP \fIcommand\fP
.fi
.IP
This hook is executed whenever you access a remote mailbox. Useful to adjust
configuration settings to different IMAP or POP servers.
.
.PP
.nf
\fBalias\fP [ \fB\-group\fP \fIname\fP ... ] \fIkey\fP \fIaddress\fP [\fB,\fP \fIaddress\fP ... ]
\fBunalias\fP [ \fB\-group\fP \fIname\fP ... ] { \fB*\fP | \fIkey\fP ... }
.fi
.IP
\fBalias\fP defines a surrogate \fIkey\fP for the given address(es). Each
\fIaddress\fP will be resolved into either an email address
(user@\:example.com) or a named email address (User Name <user@\:example.com>).
The address may be specified in either format, or in the format
\(lquser@\:example.com (User Name)\(rq.
.IP
\fBNote\fP: If you want to create an alias for more than one address, you
\fBmust\fP separate the addresses with a comma (\(lq\fB,\fP\(rq).
.IP
\fBunalias\fP removes the alias corresponding to the given \fIkey\fP or all
aliases when \(lq\fB*\fP\(rq is used as an argument.
.IP
The optional \fB\-group\fP flag causes the address(es) to be added to or
removed from the \fIname\fPd group.
.
.PP
.nf
\fBalternates\fP [ \fB\-group\fP \fIname\fP ... ] \fIregex\fP [ \fIregex\fP ... ]
\fBunalternates\fP [ \fB\-group\fP \fIname\fP ... ] { \fB*\fP | \fIregex\fP ... }
.fi
.IP
\fBalternates\fP is used to inform NeoMutt about alternate addresses where you
receive mail; you can use regular expressions (\fIregex\fP) to specify
alternate addresses. This affects NeoMutt's idea about messages from you, and
messages addressed to you.
.IP
\fBunalternates\fP can be used to write exceptions to alternates patterns. To
remove a regular expression from the alternates list, use the unalternates
command with exactly the same \fIregex\fP or use \(lq\fB*\fP\(rq to remove all
entries.
.IP
The optional \fB\-group\fP flag causes all of the subsequent regular expressions
to be added to or removed from the \fIname\fPd group.
.
.PP
.nf
\fBalternative_order\fP \fImime-type\fP[/\fImime-subtype\fP] [ \fImime-type\fP[/\fImime-subtype\fP] ... ]
\fBunalternative_order\fP { \fB*\fP | \fImime-type\fP[/\fImime-subtype\fP] ... }
.fi
.IP
\fBalternative_order\fP command permits you to define an order of preference
that is used by NeoMutt to determine which part of
a \fBmultipart/\:alternative\fP body to display. A \fImime-subtype\fP of
\(lq\fB*\fP\(rq matches any \fBmultipart/\:alternative\fP subtype, as does an
empty \fImime-subtype\fP.
.IP
\fBunalternative_order\fP removes entries from the ordered list or deletes the
entire list when \(lq\fB*\fP\(rq is used as an argument.
.
.PP
.nf
\fBattachments\fP { \fB+\fP | \fB\-\fP }\fIdisposition\fP \fImime-type\fP
\fBunattachments\fP { \fB+\fP | \fB\-\fP }\fIdisposition\fP \fImime-type\fP
.fi
.IP
You can make your message index display the number of qualifying attachments in
each message, or search for messages by attachment count. You also can
configure what kinds of attachments qualify for this feature with the
\fBattachments\fP and \fBunattachments\fP commands.
.IP
\fIdisposition\fP is the attachment's Content-Disposition type \(em either
inline or attachment. You can abbreviate this to \fBI\fP or \fBA\fP.
.IP
\fImime-type\fP is the MIME type of the attachment you want the command to
affect. A MIME type is always of the format \fBmajor/minor\fP. The major part
of \fImime-type\fP must be literal text (or the special token \(lq\fB*\fP\(rq,
but the minor part may be a regular expression. Therefore, \(lq\fB*/.*\fP\(rq
matches any MIME type.
.
.PP
.nf
\fBauto_view\fP \fImime-type\fP[\fB/\fP\fImime-subtype\fP] [ \fImime-type\fP[\fB/\fP\fImime-subtype\fP] ... ]
\fBunauto_view\fP { \fB*\fP | \fImime-type\fP[\fB/\fP\fImime-subtype\fP] ... }
.fi
.IP
This commands permits you to specify that NeoMutt should automatically convert
the given \fImime-type\fPs to text/plain when displaying messages. For this to work,
there must be a
.BR mailcap (5)
entry for the given \fImime-type\fP with the \fBcopiousoutput\fP option set.
A \fImime-subtype\fP of \(lq\fB*\fP\(rq matches any
\fBmultipart/\:alternative\fP subtype, as does an empty \fImime-subtype\fP.
.
.PP
.nf
\fBbind\fP \fImap\fP[\fB,\fP\fImap\fP ... ] \fIkey\fP \fIfunction\fP
\fBunbind\fP { \fB*\fP | \fImap\fP | [\fB,\fP\fImap\fP...]} [ \fIkey\fP ]
.fi
.IP
This command allows you to change the default or define additional key bindings
(operation invoked when pressing a key).
.IP
\fImap\fP specifies in which menu the binding belongs. Multiple \fImap\fPs may
be specified by separating them with commas (no additional whitespace is
allowed). The currently defined \fImap\fPs are:
.BR alias ", " attach ", " browser ", " compose ", " editor ", " generic ", "
.BR index ", " mix ", " pager ", " pgp ", " postpone ", " query " and " smime "."
.IP
\fIkey\fP is the key (or key sequence) you wish to bind, e.g.
\(lq\fB\(rsCa\fP\(rq for control-A. In addition, \fIkey\fP may be specified as
a three digit octal number prefixed with a \(lq\fB\(rs\fP\(rq or as a symbolic
name. The \fB<what-key>\fP function can be used to explore keycode and
symbolic names for the keys on your keyboard.
.IP
\fIfunction\fP specifies which action to take when key is pressed. Note that
the function name is to be specified without angle brackets.
.IP
Missing key sequence in \fBunbind\fP command means unbind all bindings in menus given in \fImap\fP .
.IP
For more information on keys and functions, please consult the NeoMutt manual.
.
.PP
.nf
\fBcharset-hook\fP \fIalias\fP \fIcharset\fP
\fBiconv-hook\fP \fIcharset\fP \fIlocal-charset\fP
.fi
.IP
\fBcharset-hook\fP defines an \fIalias\fP for a character set. This is useful to
properly display messages which are tagged with a character set name not known
to NeoMutt.
.IP
\fBiconv-hook\fP defines a system-specific name for a character set. This is
useful when your system's
.BR iconv (3)
implementation does not understand MIME character set names (such as
\fBiso-8859-1\fP), but instead insists on being fed with
implementation-specific character set names (such as \fB8859-1\fP). In this
specific case, you'd put \(lq\fBiconv-hook\fP\~iso-8859-1\~8859-1\(rq into your
configuration file.
.
.PP
.nf
\fBcolor\fP \fIobject\fP [ \fIattribute\fP ... ] \fIforeground\fP \fIbackground\fP

\fBuncolor\fP { index-object | header | body } { \fB*\fP | \fIpattern\fP ... }
.fi
.IP
If your terminal supports color, these commands can be used to assign
\fIforeground\fP/\:\fIbackground\fP combinations to certain \fIobject\fPs. The
currently defined \fIobject\fPs are:
.BR attach_\:headers ", "

If the sidebar is enabled the following \fIobject\fPs are also valid:
.BR sidebar_\:divider ", "
.BR sidebar_\:flagged ", "
.BR sidebar_\:highlight ", "
.BR sidebar_\:indicator ", "
.BR sidebar_\:new ", "
.BR sidebar_\:ordinary ", "
.BR sidebar_\:spoolfile "."
.IP
The \fBbody\fP and \fBheader\fP objects allow you to restrict the colorization
to a regular expression. The \fBindex-object\fP permits you to select colored
messages by pattern.
.IP
The \fBheader\fP and \fBbody\fP match \fIregex\fP in the header/body of
a message, \fBindex-object\fP can match \fIpattern\fP in the message index.
Note that IMAP server-side searches (=b, =B, =h) are not supported for color
index patterns.
.IP
Valid composeobjects include
.BR header ", " security_encrypt ", " security_sign ", "
.BR security_both ", " security_none .
.IP
Valid colors include:
.BR default ", "
.BR black ", "
.BR red ", "
.BR green ", "
.BR yellow ", "
.BR blue ", "
.BR magenta ", "
.BR cyan ", "
.BR white ", "
.BR color\fIN\fP "."
.IP
Valid attributes include:
.BR none ", " bold ", " underline ", "
.BR reverse ", and " standout .
IP
The \fBuncolor\fP command can be applied to the index, header and body objects
only. It removes entries from the list. You must specify the same \fIpattern\fP
specified in the \fBcolor\fP command for it to be removed. The pattern
\(lq\fB*\fP\(rq is a special token which means to clear the color list of all
entries.
.IP
For further information on colorization, please consult the NeoMutt manual.
.
.PP
.nf
\fBcrypt-hook\fP \fIregex\fP \fIkeyid\fP
.fi
.IP
The crypt-hook command provides a method by which you can specify the ID of the
public key to be used when encrypting messages to a certain recipient. The
meaning of \fIkeyid\fP is to be taken broadly: This can be a different email
address, a numerical \fIkeyid\fP, or even just an arbitrary search string. You
may use multiple \fBcrypt-hook\fPs with the same \fIregex\fP; multiple matching
\fBcrypt-hook\fPs result in the use of multiple \fIkeyid\fPs for a recipient.
.TP
\fBindex-format-hook\fP \fIname\fP [\fB!\fP]\fIpattern\fP \fIformat-string\fP
This command is used to inject format strings dynamically into
$index_format based on pattern matching against the current message.
.IP
The $index_format expando \fI%@name@\fP specifies a placeholder for
the injection. Index-format-hooks with the same \fIname\fP are matched
using \fIpattern\fP against the current message. Matching is done in
the order specified in the .neomuttrc, with the first match being
used. The hook's \fIformat-string\fP is then substituted and evaluated.
.
.PP
.nf
\fBexec\fP \fIfunction\fP [ \fIfunction\fP ... ]
.fi
.IP
This command can be used to execute any \fIfunction\fP. Functions are listed in
the function reference. \(lq\fBexec\fP \fIfunction\fP\(rq is equivalent to
\(lq\fBpush\fP <\fIfunction\fP>\(rq.
.
.PP
.nf
\fBfcc-save-hook\fP \fIpattern\fP \fImailbox\fP
\fBfcc-hook\fP \fIpattern\fP \fImailbox\fP
\fBsave-hook\fP \fIpattern\fP \fImailbox\fP
.fi
.IP
\fBfcc-save-hook\fP is a shortcut, equivalent to doing both a \fBfcc-hook\fP
and a \fBsave-hook\fP with its arguments, including %-expansion on
\fImailbox\fP according to $index_format.
.IP
\fBfcc-hook\fP is used to save outgoing mail in a mailbox other than $record.
NeoMutt searches the initial list of message recipients for the first matching
\fIpattern\fP and uses \fImailbox\fP as the default \(lqFcc:\(rq mailbox. If no
match is found the message will be saved to $record mailbox.
.IP
\fBsave-hook\fP is used to override the default mailbox used when saving
messages. \fImailbox\fP will be used as the default if the message matches
\fIpattern\fP.
.IP
To provide more flexibility and good defaults, NeoMutt applies the expandos of
$index_format to \fImailbox\fP after it was expanded. See \fIPATTERNS\fP
section below or consult section \(lq\fBMessage Matching in Hooks\fP\(rq in
NeoMutt manual for information on the exact format of \fIpattern\fP.
.
.PP
.nf
\fBfolder-hook\fP \fIregex\fP \fIcommand\fP
.fi
.IP
When NeoMutt enters a folder which matches \fIregex\fP (or, when \fIregex\fP is
preceded by an exclamation mark, does not match \fIregex\fP), the given
\fIcommand\fP is executed.
.IP
When several \fBfolder-hook\fPs match a given mail folder, they are executed in
the order given in the configuration file.
.
.PP
.nf
\fBgroup\fP [ \fB\-group\fP \fIname\fP ... ] { \fB\-rx\fP \fIexpr\fP ... | \fB\-addr\fP \fIaddress\fP ... }
\fBungroup\fP [ \fB\-group\fP \fIname\fP ... ] { \fB*\fP | \fB\-rx\fP \fIexpr\fP ... | \fB\-addr\fP \fIaddress\fP ... }
.fi
.IP
\fBgroup\fP is used to directly add either addresses or regular expressions to
the specified group or groups. The different categories of arguments to the
\fBgroup\fP command can be in any order. The flags \fB\-rx\fP and \fB\-addr\fP
specify what the following strings (that cannot begin with a hyphen) should be
interpreted as: either a regular expression or an email address, respectively.
.IP
\fBungroup\fP is used to remove addresses or regular expressions from the
specified group or groups. The syntax is similar to the \fBgroup\fP command,
however the special character \(lq\fB*\fP\(rq can be used to empty a group of
all of its contents.
.IP
These address groups can also be created implicitly by the \fBalias\fP,
\fBlists\fP, \fBsubscribe\fP and \fBalternates\fP commands by specifying the
optional \fB\-group\fP option.
.IP
Once defined, these address groups can be used in patterns to search for and
limit the display to messages matching a group.
.
.PP
.nf
\fBhdr_order\fP \fIheader\fP [ \fIheader\fP ... ]
\fBunhdr_order\fP { \fB*\fP | \fIheader\fP ... }
.fi
.IP
With the \fBhdr_order\fP command you can specify an order in which NeoMutt will
attempt to present these headers to you when viewing messages.
.IP
\(lq\fBunhdr_order\~*\fP\(rq will clear all previous headers from the order
list, thus removing the header order effects set by the system-wide startup
file.
.
.PP
.nf
\fBifdef\fP \fIsymbol\fP "\fIconfig-command\fP [ \fIargs\fP ... ]"
\fBifndef\fP \fIsymbol\fP "\fIconfig-command\fP [ \fIargs\fP ... ]"
\fBfinish\fP
.fi
.IP
The \fBifdef\fP feature introduces three new commands to NeoMutt and allow you
to share one config file between versions of NeoMutt that may have different
features compiled in.
.IP
Here a \fIsymbol\fP can be a
.BR $variable ", <" function ">, " command " or " "compile-time symbol" ", "
such as \(lq\fBimap\fP\(rq. A list of compile-time \fIsymbol\fPs can be seen in
the output of the command \(lq\fBneomutt\~\-v\fP\(rq (in the
\(lq\fBCompile options\fP\(rq section).
.IP
\fBfinish\fP is particularly useful when combined with \fBifndef\fP.
.
.PP
.nf
\fBignore\fP \fIpattern\fP [ \fIpattern\fP ... ]
\fBunignore\fP { \fB*\fP | \fIpattern\fP ... }
.fi
.IP
The \fBignore\fP command allows you to specify header fields which you don't
normally want to see in the pager. You do not need to specify the full header
field name. For example, \(lq\fBignore\fP content-\(rq will ignore all header
fields that begin with the pattern \(lqcontent-\(rq, \(lq\fBignore\fP\~*\(rq
will ignore all headers.
.IP
To remove a previously added token from the list, use the \fBunignore\fP
command. For example, \(lq\fBunignore\fP\~*\(rq will remove all tokens from the
ignore list.
.
.PP
.nf
\fBlists\fP [ \fB\-group\fP \fIname\fP ... ] \fIregex\fP [ \fIregex\fP ... ]
\fBunlists\fP [ \fB\-group\fP \fIname\fP ... ] { \fB*\fP | \fIregex\fP ... }
\fBsubscribe\fP [ \fB\-group\fP \fIname\fP ... ] \fIregex\fP [ \fIregex\fP ... ]
\fBunsubscribe\fP [ \fB\-group\fP \fIname\fP ... ] { \fB*\fP | \fIregex\fP ... }
.fi
.IP
NeoMutt maintains two lists of mailing list address patterns, a list of
subscribed mailing lists, and a list of known mailing lists. All subscribed
mailing lists are known. Patterns use regular expressions.
.IP
The \fBlists\fP command adds a mailing list address to the list of known
mailing lists. The \fBunlists\fP command removes a mailing list from the lists
of known and subscribed mailing lists.
.IP
The \fBsubscribe\fP command adds a mailing list to the lists of known and
subscribed mailing lists. The \fBunsubscribe\fP command removes it from the
list of subscribed mailing lists.
.IP
The \fB\-group\fP flag adds all of the subsequent regular expressions to the
\fIname\fPd group.
.
.PP
.nf
\fBmacro\fP \fImenu\fP[\fB,\fP\fImenu\fP ... ] \fIkey\fP \fIsequence\fP [ \fIdescription\fP ]
\fBunmacro\fP { \fB*\fP | \fImenu\fP | [\fB,\fP\fImenu\fP...]} [ \fIkey\fP ]
.fi
.IP
This command binds the given \fIsequence\fP of keys to the given \fIkey\fP in
the given \fImenu\fP or menus. For currently defined menus, see \fBbind\fP
command above. To specify multiple menus, put only a comma between the menus.
.IP
Optionally you can specify a descriptive text after \fIsequence\fP, which is
shown in the help screens if they contain a \fIdescription\fP.
.IP
Missing key sequence in \fBunmacro\fP command means unmacro all macros in menus given in \fImenu\fP.

.nf
\fBmailboxes\fP \fImailbox\fP [ \fImailbox\fP ... ]
\fBnamed-mailboxes\fP \fIdescription\fP \fImailbox\fP [\fIdescription\fP \fImailbox\fP ... ]
\fBunmailboxes\fP { \fB*\fP | \fImailbox\fP ... }
.fi
.IP
The \fBmailboxes\fP specifies folders which can receive mail and which will be
checked for new messages. When changing folders, pressing space will cycle
through folders with new mail.
.IP
The \fBnamed-mailboxes\fP is an alternative to \fBmailboxes\fP that allows
adding a description for a mailbox. NeoMutt can be configured to display the
description instead of the mailbox path.
.IP
The \fBunmailboxes\fP command is used to remove a file name from the list of
folders which can receive mail. If \(lq\fB*\fP\(rq is specified as the file
name, the list is emptied.
.
.PP
.nf
\fBmailto_allow\fP { \fB*\fP | \fIheader-field\fP ... }
\fBunmailto_allow\fP { \fB*\fP | \fIheader-field\fP ... }
.fi
.IP
As a security measure, NeoMutt will only add user-approved \fIheader-field\fPs
from a \fImailto:\fP URL. This is necessary since NeoMutt will handle certain
\fIheader-field\fPs, such as \fBAttach\fP, in a special way. The
\fBmailto_allow\fP and \fBunmailto_allow\fP commands allow the user to modify
the list of approved headers.
.IP
NeoMutt initializes the default list to contain only the \fBSubject\fP and
\fBBody\fP \fIheader-field\fPs, which are the only requirement specified by the
\fImailto:\fP specification in RFC2368, and the \fBCc\fP, \fBIn-Reply-To\fP,
\fBReferences\fP headers to aid with replies to mailing lists.
.TP
\fBecho\fP \fImessage\fP
Prints \fImessage\fP to the message window. After printing the
message, echo will pause for the number of seconds specified by

.IP
When NeoMutt changes to a mail folder which matches \fIregex\fP, \fImailbox\fP
will be used as the \(lqmbox\(rq folder, i.e. read messages will be moved to
that folder when the mail folder is left.
.IP
Note that execution of \fBmbox-hook\fPs is dependent on the $move configuration
variable. If set to \(lqno\(rq (the default), \fBmbox-hook\fPs will not be
executed.

\fBunmime_lookup\fP { \fB*\fP | \fImime-type\fP[\fB/\fP\fImime-subtype\fP] ... }
.fi
.IP
This command permits you to define a list of \(lqdata\(rq MIME content types
for which NeoMutt will try to determine the actual file type from the file
name, and not use a
.BR mailcap (5)
entry given for the original MIME type. For instance, you may add the
\fBapplication/\:octet-stream\fP MIME type to this list.

NeoMutt knows four basic types of \fIvariable\fPs: boolean, number, string, string
list and quadoption. Boolean \fIvariable\fPs can be \fBset\fP (true), \fBunset\fP
(false), or \fBtoggle\fPd. Number \fIvariable\fPs can be assigned a positive
integer \fIvalue\fP. Value of number \fIvariable\fPs can be incremented "\fB+=\fP"
and decremented "\fB-=\fP". String list \fIvariable\fPs use "\fB+=\fP" for
appending increment to the string list and "\fB-=\fP" for removal decrement from
the string list.
.IP
String \fIvariable\fPs consist of any number of printable characters and must
be enclosed in quotes if they contain spaces or tabs. You may also use the
escape sequences \(lq\fB\(rsn\fP\(rq and \(lq\fB\(rst\fP\(rq for newline and
tab, respectively. Content of a string \fIvariable\fPs can be extended using
"\fB+=\fP"
.IP
Quadoption \fIvariable\fPs are used to control whether or not to be prompted
for certain actions, or to specify a default action. A \fIvalue\fP of \fByes\fP
will cause the action to be carried out automatically as if you had answered
\(lqyes\(rq to the question. Similarly, a \fIvalue\fP of \fBno\fP will cause
the action to be carried out as if you had answered \(lqno\(rq.  A \fIvalue\fP
of \fBask-yes\fP will cause a prompt with a default answer of \(lqyes\(rq and
\fBask-no\fP will provide a default answer of \(lqno\(rq.
.IP
The \fBtoggle\fP command automatically prepends the \(lq\fBinv\fP\(rq prefix to
all specified \fIvariable\fPs. The \fBunset\fP command automatically prepends
the \(lq\fBno\fP\(rq prefix to all specified \fIvariable\fPs. If you use the
command \fBset\fP and prefix the \fIvariable\fP with \(lq\fB&\fP\(rq this has
the same behavior as the \fBreset\fP command.

The \fBreset\fP command resets all given \fIvariable\fPs to the compile time

\fBall\fP, which allows you to reset all \fIvariable\fPs to their system
defaults.

Special attention has to be paid when using regular expressions inside of
patterns. Specifically, NeoMutt's parser for these patterns will strip one
level of backslash (\(lq\fB\(rs\fP\(rq), which is normally used for quoting. If
it is your intention to use a backslash in the regular expression, you will
need to use two backslashes (\(lq\fB\(rs\(rs\fP\(rq) instead.
.
.PP
You can force NeoMutt to treat \fIEXPR\fP as a simple \fISTRING\fP instead of
a regular expression by using \(lq\fB=\fP\(rq instead of \(lq\fB~\fP\(rq in the
pattern name. For example, \(lq\fB=b\~*.*\fP\(rq will find all messages that
contain the literal \fISTRING\fP \(lq\fB*.*\fP\(rq. Simple substring matches
are less powerful than regular expressions but can be considerably faster. This
is especially true for IMAP folders, because substring matches can be performed
on the server instead of by fetching every message. IMAP treats
\(lq\fB=h\fP\(rq specially: it must be of the form
\(lqHeader:\~\fIsubstring\fP\(rq and will \fBnot\fP partially match header
names. The \fIsubstring\fP part may be omitted if you simply wish to find
messages containing a particular header without regard to its value.

Patterns matching lists of addresses (notably
.BR c ", " C ", " p ", " P " and " t )
match if there is at least one match in the whole list. If you want to make

all messages after the given date will be selected. If you specify a single
date with no dash (\(lq\fB-\fP\(rq), only messages sent/received on the given

You can add error margins to absolute dates. An error margin is a sign
(\(lq\fB+\fP\(rq or \(lq\fB-\fP\(rq), followed by a digit, followed by one of
the units in table \(lq\fBDate units\fP\(rq below. As a special case, you can
replace the sign by a \(lq\fB*\fP\(rq character, which is equivalent to giving
identical plus and minus error margins.

.TP
.B abort_backspace
.nf
Type: boolean
Default: yes
.fi
.IP
If \fIset\fP, hitting backspace against an empty prompt aborts the
prompt.


.TP
.B abort_key
.nf
Type: string
Default: "007"
.fi
.IP
Specifies the key that can be used to abort prompts.  The format is the
same as used in "bind" commands.  The default is equivalent to "\\G".
Note that the specified key should not be used in other bindings, as the
abort operation has higher precedence and the binding will not have the
desired effect.
.IP
Example:

.IP
.EX
set abort_key = "<Esc>"

.EE
.IP
Please note that when using <Esc> as the abort key, you may also want to
set the environment variable ESCDELAY to a low value or even 0 which will
reduce the time that ncurses waits to distinguish singular <Esc> key
presses from the start of a terminal escape sequence. The default time is
1000 milliseconds and thus quite noticeable.


.TP
.B abort_noattach
.nf
Type: quadoption
Default: no
.fi
.IP
If set to \fIyes\fP, when composing messages containing the regular
expression specified by $abort_noattach_regex and no attachments are
given, composition will be aborted. If set to \fIno\fP, composing messages
as such will never be aborted.
.IP
Example:

.IP
.EX
set abort_noattach_regex = "\\\\<attach(|ed|ments?)\\\\>"

.EE


.TP
.B abort_noattach_regex
.nf
Type: regular expression
Default: "\\<(attach|attached|attachments?)\\>"
.fi
.IP
Specifies a regular expression to match against the body of the message, to
determine if an attachment was mentioned but mistakenly forgotten.  If it
matches, $abort_noattach will be consulted to determine if message sending
will be aborted.
.IP
Like other regular expressions in NeoMutt, the search is case sensitive
if the pattern contains at least one upper case letter, and case
insensitive otherwise.


.TP
.B abort_nosubject
.nf
Type: quadoption
Default: ask\-yes
.fi
.IP
If set to \fIyes\fP, when composing messages and no subject is given
at the subject prompt, composition will be aborted.  If set to
\fIno\fP, composing messages with no subject given at the subject
prompt will never be aborted.


.TP
.B abort_unmodified
.nf
Type: quadoption
Default: yes
.fi
.IP
If set to \fIyes\fP, composition will automatically abort after
editing the message body if no changes are made to the file (this
check only happens after the \fIfirst\fP edit of the file).  When set
to \fIno\fP, composition will never be aborted.


.TP
.B alias_file
.nf
Type: path
Default: "~/.neomuttrc"
.fi
.IP
The default file in which to save aliases created by the
\fC<create-alias>\fP function. Entries added to this file are
encoded in the character set specified by $config_charset if it
is \fIset\fP or the current character set otherwise.
.IP
\fBNote:\fP NeoMutt will not automatically source this file; you must
explicitly use the "source" command for it to be executed in case
this option points to a dedicated alias file.
.IP
The default for this option is the currently used neomuttrc file, or
"~/.neomuttrc" if no user neomuttrc was found.


.TP
.B alias_format
.nf
Type: string
Default: "%3n %f%t %\-15a %\-56r | %c"
.fi
.IP
Specifies the format of the data displayed for the "alias" menu.  The
following \fCprintf(3)\fP\-style sequences are available:

.IP
Controls whether 8\-bit data is converted to 7\-bit using either Quoted\-
Printable or Base64 encoding when sending mail.


.TP
.B allow_ansi
.nf
Type: boolean
Default: no
.fi
.IP
Controls whether ANSI color codes in messages (and color tags in
rich text messages) are to be interpreted.
Messages containing these codes are rare, but if this option is \fIset\fP,
their text will be colored accordingly. Note that this may override
your color choices, and even present a security problem, since a
message could include a line like

.IP
.EX
[\-\- PGP output follows ...

.EE
.IP
and give it the same color as your attachment color (see also
$crypt_timestamp).


.TP
.B arrow_cursor
.nf
Type: boolean
Default: no
.fi
.IP
When \fIset\fP, an arrow ("\->") will be used to indicate the current entry
in menus instead of highlighting the whole line.  On slow network or modem
links this will make response faster because there is less that has to
be redrawn on the screen when moving to the next or previous entries
in the menu.


.TP
.B arrow_string
.nf
Type: string
Default: "\->"
.fi
.IP
Specifies the string of arrow_cursor when arrow_cursor enabled.


.TP
.B ascii_chars
.nf
Type: boolean
Default: no
.fi
.IP
If \fIset\fP, NeoMutt will use plain ASCII characters when displaying thread
and attachment trees, instead of the default \fIACS\fP characters.


.TP
.B ask_follow_up
.nf
Type: boolean
Default: no
.fi
.IP
If set, NeoMutt will prompt you for follow\-up groups before editing
the body of an outgoing message.


.TP
.B ask_x_comment_to
.nf
Type: boolean
Default: no
.fi
.IP
If set, NeoMutt will prompt you for x\-comment\-to field before editing
the body of an outgoing message.


.TP
.B askbcc
.nf
Type: boolean
Default: no
.fi
.IP
If \fIset\fP, NeoMutt will prompt you for blind\-carbon\-copy (Bcc) recipients
before editing an outgoing message.


.TP
.B askcc
.nf
Type: boolean
Default: no
.fi
.IP
If \fIset\fP, NeoMutt will prompt you for carbon\-copy (Cc) recipients before
editing the body of an outgoing message.


.TP
.B assumed_charset
.nf
Type: string
Default: ""
.fi
.IP
This variable is a colon\-separated list of character encoding
schemes for messages without character encoding indication.
Header field values and message body content without character encoding
indication would be assumed that they are written in one of this list.
By default, all the header fields and message body without any charset
indication are assumed to be in "us\-ascii".
.IP
For example, Japanese users might prefer this:

.IP
.EX
set assumed_charset="iso\-2022\-jp:euc\-jp:shift_jis:utf\-8"

.EE
.IP
However, only the first content is valid for the message body.


.TP
.B attach_charset
.nf
Type: string
Default: ""
.fi
.IP
This variable is a colon\-separated list of character encoding
schemes for text file attachments. NeoMutt uses this setting to guess
which encoding files being attached are encoded in to convert them to
a proper character set given in $send_charset.
.IP
If \fIunset\fP, the value of $charset will be used instead.
For example, the following configuration would work for Japanese
text handling:

.IP
.EX
set attach_charset="iso\-2022\-jp:euc\-jp:shift_jis:utf\-8"

.EE
.IP
Note: for Japanese users, "iso\-2022\-*" must be put at the head
of the value as shown above if included.

.B attach_save_dir
.nf
Type: path
Default: "./"
.fi
.IP
The directory where attachments are saved.


.TP
.B attach_save_without_prompting
.nf
Type: boolean
Default: no
.fi
.IP
This variable, when set to true, will cause attachments to be saved to
the 'attach_save_dir' location without prompting the user for the filename.
.IP


.TP
.B attach_sep
.nf
Type: string
Default: "\\n"
.fi
.IP
The separator to add between attachments when operating (saving,
printing, piping, etc) on a list of tagged attachments.


.TP
.B attach_split
.nf
Type: boolean
Default: yes
.fi
.IP
If this variable is \fIunset\fP, when operating (saving, printing, piping,
etc) on a list of tagged attachments, NeoMutt will concatenate the
attachments and will operate on them as a single attachment. The
$attach_sep separator is added after each attachment. When \fIset\fP,
NeoMutt will operate on the attachments one by one.


.TP
.B attribution
.nf
Type: string
Default: "On %d, %n wrote:"
.fi
.IP
This is the string that will precede a message which has been included
in a reply.  For a full listing of defined \fCprintf(3)\fP\-like sequences see
the section on $index_format.


.TP
.B attribution_locale
.nf
Type: string
Default: ""
.fi
.IP
The locale used by \fCstrftime(3)\fP to format dates in the
attribution string.  Legal values are the strings your system
accepts for the locale environment variable \fC$LC_TIME\fP.
.IP
This variable is to allow the attribution date format to be
customized by recipient or folder using hooks.  By default, NeoMutt
will use your locale environment, so there is no need to set
this except to override that default.


.TP
.B auto_subscribe
.nf
Type: boolean
Default: no
.fi
.IP
When \fIset\fP, NeoMutt assumes the presence of a List\-Post header
means the recipient is subscribed to the list.  Unless the mailing list
is in the "unsubscribe" or "unlist" lists, it will be added
to the "subscribe" list.  Parsing and checking these things slows
header reading down, so this option is disabled by default.


.TP
.B auto_tag
.nf
Type: boolean
Default: no
.fi
.IP
When \fIset\fP, functions in the \fIindex\fP menu which affect a message
will be applied to all tagged messages (if there are any).  When
unset, you must first use the \fC<tag\-prefix>\fP function (bound to ";"
by default) to make the next function apply to all tagged messages.


.TP
.B autocrypt
.nf
Type: boolean
Default: no

.TP
.B autocrypt_reply
.nf
Type: boolean
Default: yes
.fi
.IP
When \fIset\fP, replying to an autocrypt email automatically
enables autocrypt in the reply.  You may want to unset this if you're using
the same key for autocrypt as normal web\-of\-trust, so that autocrypt
isn't forced on for all encrypted replies.
(Autocrypt only)


.TP
.B autoedit
.nf
Type: boolean
Default: no
.fi
.IP
When \fIset\fP along with $edit_headers, NeoMutt will skip the initial
send\-menu (prompting for subject and recipients) and allow you to
immediately begin editing the body of your
message.  The send\-menu may still be accessed once you have finished
editing the body of your message.
.IP
\fBNote:\fP when this option is \fIset\fP, you can't use send\-hooks that depend
on the recipients when composing a new (non\-reply) message, as the initial
list of recipients is empty.
.IP
Also see $fast_reply.


.TP
.B beep
.nf
Type: boolean
Default: yes
.fi
.IP
When this variable is \fIset\fP, NeoMutt will beep when an error occurs.


.TP
.B beep_new
.nf
Type: boolean
Default: no
.fi
.IP
When this variable is \fIset\fP, NeoMutt will beep whenever it prints a message
notifying you of new mail.  This is independent of the setting of the
$beep variable.


.TP
.B bounce
.nf
Type: quadoption
Default: ask\-yes
.fi
.IP
Controls whether you will be asked to confirm bouncing messages.
If set to \fIyes\fP you don't get asked if you want to bounce a
message. Setting this variable to \fIno\fP is not generally useful,
and thus not recommended, because you are unable to bounce messages.


.TP
.B bounce_delivered
.nf
Type: boolean
Default: yes
.fi
.IP
When this variable is \fIset\fP, NeoMutt will include Delivered\-To headers when
bouncing messages.  Postfix users may wish to \fIunset\fP this variable.


.TP
.B braille_friendly
.nf
Type: boolean
Default: no
.fi
.IP
When this variable is \fIset\fP, NeoMutt will place the cursor at the beginning
of the current line in menus, even when the $arrow_cursor variable
is \fIunset\fP, making it easier for blind persons using Braille displays to
follow these menus.  The option is \fIunset\fP by default because many
visual terminals don't permit making the cursor invisible.


.TP
.B browser_abbreviate_mailboxes
.nf
Type: boolean
Default: yes
.fi
.IP
When this variable is \fIset\fP, NeoMutt will abbreviate mailbox
names in the browser mailbox list, using '~' and '='
shortcuts.
.IP
The default \fC"alpha"\fP setting of $sort_browser uses
locale\-based sorting (using \fCstrcoll(3)\fP), which ignores some
punctuation.  This can lead to some situations where the order
doesn't make intuitive sense.  In those cases, it may be
desirable to \fIunset\fP this variable.


.TP
.B catchup_newsgroup
.nf
Type: quadoption
Default: ask\-yes
.fi
.IP
If this variable is \fIset\fP, NeoMutt will mark all articles in newsgroup
as read when you quit the newsgroup (catchup newsgroup).


.TP
.B certificate_file
.nf
Type: path
Default: "~/.mutt_certificates"
.fi
.IP
This variable specifies the file where the certificates you trust
are saved. When an unknown certificate is encountered, you are asked
if you accept it or not. If you accept it, the certificate can also
be saved in this file and further connections are automatically
accepted.
.IP
You can also manually add CA certificates in this file. Any server
certificate that is signed with one of these CA certificates is
also automatically accepted.
.IP
Example:

.IP
.EX
set certificate_file=~/.neomutt/certificates

.EE


.TP
.B change_folder_next
.nf
Type: boolean
Default: no
.fi
.IP
When this variable is \fIset\fP, the \fC<change\-folder>\fP function
mailbox suggestion will start at the next folder in your "mailboxes"
list, instead of starting at the first folder in the list.


.TP
.B charset
.nf
Type: string
Default: ""
.fi
.IP
Character set your terminal uses to display and enter textual data.
It is also the fallback for $send_charset.
.IP
Upon startup NeoMutt tries to derive this value from environment variables
such as \fC$LC_CTYPE\fP or \fC$LANG\fP.
.IP
\fBNote:\fP It should only be set in case NeoMutt isn't able to determine the
character set used correctly.


.TP
.B check_mbox_size
.nf
Type: boolean
Default: no
.fi
.IP
When this variable is \fIset\fP, NeoMutt will use file size attribute instead of
access time when checking for new mail in mbox and mmdf folders.
.IP
This variable is \fIunset\fP by default and should only be enabled when
new mail detection for these folder types is unreliable or doesn't work.
.IP
Note that enabling this variable should happen before any "mailboxes"
directives occur in configuration files regarding mbox or mmdf folders
because NeoMutt needs to determine the initial new mail status of such a
mailbox by performing a fast mailbox scan when it is defined.
Afterwards the new mail status is tracked by file size changes.


.TP
.B check_new
.nf
Type: boolean
Default: yes
.fi
.IP
\fBNote:\fP this option only affects \fImaildir\fP and \fIMH\fP style
mailboxes.
.IP
When \fIset\fP, NeoMutt will check for new mail delivered while the
mailbox is open.  Especially with MH mailboxes, this operation can
take quite some time since it involves scanning the directory and
checking each file to see if it has already been looked at.  If
this variable is \fIunset\fP, no check for new mail is performed
while the mailbox is open.


.TP
.B collapse_all
.nf
Type: boolean
Default: no
.fi
.IP
When \fIset\fP, NeoMutt will collapse all threads when entering a folder.


.TP
.B collapse_flagged
.nf
Type: boolean
Default: yes
.fi
.IP
When \fIunset\fP, NeoMutt will not collapse a thread if it contains any
flagged messages.


.TP
.B collapse_unread
.nf
Type: boolean
Default: yes
.fi
.IP
When \fIunset\fP, NeoMutt will not collapse a thread if it contains any
unread messages.


.TP
.B compose_format
.nf
Type: string
Default: "\-\- NeoMutt: Compose  [Approx. msg size: %l   Atts: %a]%>\-"
.fi
.IP
Controls the format of the status line displayed in the "compose"
menu.  This string is similar to $status_format, but has its own
set of \fCprintf(3)\fP\-like sequences:
.RS
.PD 0
.TP

.TP
.B compose_show_user_headers
.nf
Type: boolean
Default: yes
.fi
.IP
When \fIset\fP, Neomutt will display user\-defined headers (set via my_hdr
or from editing with edit\-headers).


.TP
.B config_charset
.nf
Type: string
Default: ""
.fi
.IP
When defined, NeoMutt will recode commands in rc files from this
encoding to the current character set as specified by $charset
and aliases written to $alias_file from the current character set.
.IP
Please note that if setting $charset it must be done before
setting $config_charset.
.IP
Recoding should be avoided as it may render unconvertable
characters as question marks which can lead to undesired
side effects (for example in regular expressions).


.TP
.B confirmappend
.nf
Type: boolean
Default: yes
.fi
.IP
When \fIset\fP, NeoMutt will prompt for confirmation when appending messages to
an existing mailbox.


.TP
.B confirmcreate
.nf
Type: boolean
Default: yes
.fi
.IP
When \fIset\fP, NeoMutt will prompt for confirmation when saving messages to a
mailbox which does not yet exist before creating it.


.TP
.B connect_timeout
.nf
Type: number
Default: 30
.fi
.IP
Causes NeoMutt to timeout a network connection (for IMAP, POP or SMTP) after this
many seconds if the connection is not able to be established.  A negative
value causes NeoMutt to wait indefinitely for the connection attempt to succeed.


.TP
.B content_type
.nf
Type: string
Default: "text/plain"
.fi
.IP
Sets the default Content\-Type for the body of newly composed messages.


.TP
.B copy
.nf
Type: quadoption
Default: yes
.fi
.IP
This variable controls whether or not copies of your outgoing messages
will be saved for later references.  Also see $record,
$save_name, $force_name and "fcc-hook".


.TP
.B copy_decode_weed
.nf
Type: boolean
Default: no

.IP
Controls whether NeoMutt will weed headers when invoking the
\fC<decode\-copy>\fP or \fC<decode\-save>\fP functions.


.TP
.B count_alternatives
.nf
Type: boolean
Default: no
.fi
.IP
When \fIset\fP, Mutt will recurse inside multipart/alternatives while
performing attachment searching and counting(see attachments).
.IP
Traditionally, multipart/alternative parts have simply represented
different encodings of the main content of the email.  Unfortunately,
some mail clients have started to place email attachments inside
one of alternatives.  Setting this will allow Mutt to find
and count matching attachments hidden there, and include them
in the index via %X or through ~X pattern matching.


.TP
.B crypt_autoencrypt
.nf
Type: boolean
Default: no
.fi
.IP
Setting this variable will cause NeoMutt to always attempt to PGP
encrypt outgoing messages.  This is probably only useful in
connection to the "send-hook" command.  It can be overridden
by use of the pgp menu, when encryption is not required or
signing is requested as well.  If $smime_is_default is \fIset\fP,
then OpenSSL is used instead to create S/MIME messages and
settings can be overridden by use of the smime menu instead.

Setting this variable will cause NeoMutt to always attempt to
cryptographically sign outgoing messages.  This can be overridden
by use of the pgp menu, when signing is not required or
encryption is requested as well. If $smime_is_default is \fIset\fP,
then OpenSSL is used instead to create S/MIME messages and settings can
be overridden by use of the smime menu instead of the pgp menu.

be presented.  This is generally considered unsafe, especially where
typos are concerned.


.TP
.B crypt_opportunistic_encrypt
.nf
Type: boolean
Default: no
.fi
.IP
Setting this variable will cause NeoMutt to automatically enable and
disable encryption, based on whether all message recipient keys
can be located by NeoMutt.
.IP
When this option is enabled, NeoMutt will enable/disable encryption
each time the TO, CC, and BCC lists are edited.  If
$edit_headers is set, NeoMutt will also do so each time the message
is edited.
.IP
While this is set, encryption can't be manually enabled/disabled.
The pgp or smime menus provide a selection to temporarily disable
this option for the current message.

.TP
.B crypt_opportunistic_encrypt_strong_keys
.nf
Type: boolean
Default: no
.fi
.IP
When set, this modifies the behavior of $crypt_opportunistic_encrypt
to only search for "strong keys", that is, keys with full validity
according to the web\-of\-trust algorithm.  A key with marginal or no
validity will not enable opportunistic encryption.
.IP
For S/MIME, the behavior depends on the backend.  Classic S/MIME will
filter for certificates with the 't'(trusted) flag in the .index file.
The GPGME backend will use the same filters as with OpenPGP, and depends
on GPGME's logic for assigning the GPGME_VALIDITY_FULL and
GPGME_VALIDITY_ULTIMATE validity flag.


.TP
.B crypt_protected_headers_read
.nf
Type: boolean
Default: yes
.fi
.IP
When set, NeoMutt will display protected headers ("Memory Hole") in the pager,
When set, NeoMutt will display protected headers in the pager,
and will update the index and header cache with revised headers.
.IP
Protected headers are stored inside the encrypted or signed part of an
an email, to prevent disclosure or tampering.
For more information see https://github.com/autocrypt/protected\-headers
Currently NeoMutt only supports the Subject header.
.IP
Encrypted messages using protected headers often substitute the exposed
Subject header with a dummy value (see $crypt_protected_headers_subject).
NeoMutt will update its concept of the correct subject \fBafter\fP the
message is opened, i.e. via the \fC<display\-message>\fP function.
If you reply to a message before opening it, NeoMutt will end up using
the dummy Subject header, so be sure to open such a message first.

.TP
.B crypt_protected_headers_save
.nf
Type: boolean
Default: no
.fi
.IP
When $crypt_protected_headers_read is set, and a message with a
protected Subject is opened, NeoMutt will save the updated Subject
into the header cache by default.  This allows searching/limiting
based on the protected Subject header if the mailbox is
re\-opened, without having to re\-open the message each time.
However, for mbox/mh mailbox types, or if header caching is not
set up, you would need to re\-open the message each time the
mailbox was reopened before you could see or search/limit on the
protected subject again.
.IP
When this variable is set, NeoMutt additionally saves the protected
Subject back \fBin the clear\-text message headers\fP.  This
provides better usability, but with the tradeoff of reduced
security.  The protected Subject header, which may have
previously been encrypted, is now stored in clear\-text in the
message headers.  Copying the message elsewhere, via NeoMutt or
external tools, could expose this previously encrypted data.
Please make sure you understand the consequences of this before
you enable this variable.

.TP
.B crypt_timestamp
.nf
Type: boolean
Default: yes

This variable controls the use of the GPGME\-enabled crypto backends.
If it is \fIset\fP and NeoMutt was built with GPGME support, the gpgme code for
S/MIME and PGP will be used instead of the classic code.  Note that
you need to set this option in .neomuttrc; it won't have any effect when
used interactively.

.IP
Unless the first character in the string is a bang ("!"), the month
and week day names are expanded according to the locale.
If the first character in the string is a
bang, the bang is discarded, and the month and week day names in the
rest of the string are expanded in the \fIC\fP locale (that is in US
English).

.IP
Debug logging is controlled by the variables \fC$debug_file\fP and \fC$debug_level\fP.
\fC$debug_file\fP specifies the root of the filename.  NeoMutt will add "0" to the end.
Each time NeoMutt is run with logging enabled, the log files are rotated.
A maximum of five log files are kept, numbered 0 (most recent) to 4 (oldest).

The debug level controls how much information is saved to the log file.
If you have a problem with NeoMutt, then enabling logging may help find the cause.
Levels 1\-3 will usually provide enough information for writing a bug report.

This variable controls how "message-hook", "reply-hook", "send-hook",
"send2-hook", "save-hook", and "fcc-hook" will
be interpreted if they are specified with only a simple regex,
instead of a matching pattern.  The hooks are expanded when they are
declared, so a hook will be interpreted according to the value of this
variable at the time the hook is declared.
.IP
The default value matches
if the message is either from a user matching the regular expression
given, or if it is from you (if the from address matches
"alternates") and is to or cc'ed to a user matching the given
regular expression.


.TP
.B delete

synchronizing a mailbox.  If set to \fIyes\fP, messages marked for
deleting will automatically be purged without prompting.  If set to
\fIno\fP, messages marked for deletion will be kept in the mailbox.


.TP
.B delete_untag
.nf
Type: boolean
Default: yes

.IP
If this option is \fIset\fP, NeoMutt will untag messages when marking them
for deletion.  This applies when you either explicitly delete a message,
or when you save it to another folder.


.TP
.B digest_collapse
.nf
Type: boolean
Default: yes
.fi
.IP
If this option is \fIset\fP, NeoMutt's received\-attachments menu will not show the subparts of
individual messages in a multipart/digest.  To see these subparts, press "v" on that menu.


.TP
.B display_filter
.nf
Type: command
Default: ""
.fi
.IP
When set, specifies a command used to filter messages.  When a message
is viewed it is passed as standard input to $display_filter, and the
filtered message is read from the standard output.
.IP
When preparing the message, NeoMutt inserts some escape sequences into the
text.  They are of the form: \fC<esc>]9;XXX<bel>\fP where "XXX" is a random
64\-bit number.
.IP
If these escape sequences interfere with your filter, they can be removed
using a tool like \fCansifilter\fP or \fCsed 's/^\\x1b]9;[0\-9]\\+\\x7//'\fP
.IP
If they are removed, then PGP and MIME headers will no longer be coloured.
This can be fixed by adding this to your config:
\fCcolor body magenta default '^\\[\-\- .* \-\-\\]$'\fP.


.TP
.B dsn_notify
.nf
Type: string

This variable sets the request for when notification is returned.  The
string consists of a comma separated list (no spaces!) of one or more
of the following: \fInever\fP, to never request notification,
\fIfailure\fP, to request notification on transmission failure,
\fIdelay\fP, to be notified of message delays, \fIsuccess\fP, to be

.B duplicate_threads
.nf
Type: boolean
Default: yes

.IP
This variable controls whether NeoMutt, when $sort is set to \fIthreads\fP, threads
messages with the same Message\-Id together.  If it is \fIset\fP, it will indicate
that it thinks they are duplicates of each other with an equals sign
in the thread tree.


.TP
.B edit_headers
.nf
Type: boolean
Default: no
.fi
.IP
This option allows you to edit the header of your outgoing messages
along with the body of your message.
.IP
Although the compose menu may have localized header labels, the
labels passed to your editor will be standard RFC2822 headers,
(e.g. To:, Cc:, Subject:).  Headers added in your editor must
also be RFC2822 headers, or one of the pseudo headers listed in
"edit-header".  NeoMutt will not understand localized header
labels, just as it would not when parsing an actual email.
.IP
\fBNote\fP that changes made to the References: and Date: headers are
ignored for interoperability reasons.


.TP
.B editor
.nf
Type: command
Default: "vi"
.fi
.IP
This variable specifies which editor is used by NeoMutt.
It defaults to the value of the \fC$VISUAL\fP, or \fC$EDITOR\fP, environment
variable, or to the string "vi" if neither of those are set.
.IP
The \fC$editor\fP string may contain a \fI%s\fP escape, which will be replaced by the name
of the file to be edited.  If the \fI%s\fP escape does not appear in \fC$editor\fP, a
space and the name to be edited are appended.
.IP
The resulting string is then executed by running

.IP
.EX
sh \-c 'string'

.EE
.IP
where \fIstring\fP is the expansion of \fC$editor\fP described above.

.fi
.IP
This variable specifies the subject to be used when replying to an email
with an empty subject.  It defaults to "Re: your mail".


.TP
.B encode_from
.nf
Type: boolean
Default: no
.fi
.IP
When \fIset\fP, NeoMutt will quoted\-printable encode messages when
they contain the string "From " (note the trailing space) in the beginning of a line.
This is useful to avoid the tampering certain mail delivery and transport
agents tend to do with messages (in order to prevent tools from
misinterpreting the line as a mbox message separator).


.TP
.B entropy_file
.nf
Type: path

Manually sets the \fIenvelope\fP sender for outgoing messages.
This value is ignored if $use_envelope_from is \fIunset\fP.


.TP
.B external_search_command
.nf
Type: command
Default: ""
.fi
.IP
If set, contains the name of the external program used by "~I" patterns.
This will usually be a wrapper script around mairix, mu, or similar
indexers other than notmuch (for which there is optional special support).
.IP
Here is an example how it works.  Let's assume $external_search_command
is set to "mairix_filter", and mairix_filter is a script which
runs the old but well loved mairix indexer with the arguments
given to mairix_filter, in the "raw" mode of mairix, producing
on the standard output a list of Message\-IDs, one per line.
.IP
If possible, it also filters down the results coming from mairix
such that only messages in the current folder remain.  It can do
this because it gets a hidden first argument which is the path
to the folder.
(This can be the type of clean and simple script called a \fIone\-liner\fP.)
.IP
Now if NeoMutt gets a limit or tag command followed by the pattern
"~I '\-t s:bleeping='", mairix_filter runs mairix with the
arguments from inside the quotes (the quotes are needed because
of the space after "\-t"), mairix finds all messages with
"bleeping" in the Subject plus all messages sharing threads
with these and outputs their file names, and mairix_filter
translates the file names into Message\-IDs.  Finally, NeoMutt
reads the Message\-IDs and targets the matching messages with the
command given to it.
.IP
You, the user, still have to rewrite the mairix_filter script to
match the behavior of your indexer, but this should help users
of indexers other than notmuch to integrate them cleanly with NeoMutt.

Controls whether or not the "Mail\-Followup\-To:" header field is
generated when sending mail.  When \fIset\fP, NeoMutt will generate this
field when you are replying to a known mailing list, specified with
the "subscribe" or "lists" commands.
.IP
This field has two purposes.  First, preventing you from
receiving duplicate copies of replies to messages which you send
to mailing lists, and second, ensuring that you do get a reply
separately for any messages sent to known lists to which you are
not subscribed.
.IP
The header will contain only the list's address
for subscribed lists, and both the list address and your own
email address for unsubscribed lists.  Without this header, a
group reply to your message sent to a subscribed list will be
sent to both the list and your address, resulting in two copies
of the same email for you.

When \fIset\fP, the outer layer of encryption is stripped off.  This
variable is only used if $mime_forward is \fIset\fP and
$mime_forward_decode is \fIunset\fP.
(PGP only)


.TP
.B forward_edit
.nf
Type: quadoption
Default: yes
.fi
.IP
This quadoption controls whether or not the user is automatically
placed in the editor when forwarding messages.  For those who always want
to forward with no modification, use a setting of "no".


.TP
.B forward_format
.nf
Type: string
Default: "[%a: %s]"
.fi
.IP
This variable controls the default subject when forwarding a message.
It uses the same format sequences as the $index_format variable.


.TP
.B forward_quote
.nf
Type: boolean
Default: no
.fi
.IP
When \fIset\fP, forwarded messages included in the main body of the
message (when $mime_forward is \fIunset\fP) will be quoted using
$indent_string.


.TP
.B forward_references
.nf
Type: boolean
Default: no
.fi
.IP
When \fIset\fP, forwarded messages set the "In\-Reply\-To:" and
"References:" headers in the same way as normal replies would. Hence the
forwarded message becomes part of the original thread instead of starting
a new one.


.TP
.B from
.nf
Type: e-mail address
Default: ""
.fi
.IP
When \fIset\fP, this variable contains a default "from" address.  It
can be overridden using "my_hdr" (including from a "send-hook") and
$reverse_name.  This variable is ignored if $use_from is \fIunset\fP.
.IP
If not specified, then it may be read from the environment variable \fC$EMAIL\fP.


.TP
.B from_chars
.nf
Type: character string
Default: ""
.fi
.IP
Controls the character used to prefix the %F and %L fields in the
index.
.RS
.PD 0
.TP
\fBCharacter\fP 
\fBDescription\fP

.PD 1
.IP
If this is empty or unset (default), the traditional long "To ",
"Cc " and "Bcc " prefixes are used.  If set but too short to
include a character for a particular case, a single space will be
prepended to the field.  To prevent any prefix at all from being
added in a particular case, use the special value CR (aka ^M)
for the corresponding character.
.IP
This slightly odd interface is necessitated by NeoMutt's handling of
string variables; one can't tell a variable that is unset from one
that is set to the empty string.


.TP
.B gecos_mask
.nf
Type: regular expression
Default: "^[^,]*"
.fi
.IP
A regular expression used by NeoMutt to parse the GECOS field of a password
entry when expanding the alias.  The default value
will return the string up to the first "," encountered.
If the GECOS field contains a string like "lastname, firstname" then you
should set it to "\fC.*\fP".
.IP
This can be useful if you see the following behavior: you address an e\-mail
to user ID "stevef" whose full name is "Steve Franklin".  If NeoMutt expands
"stevef" to '"Franklin" stevef@foo.bar' then you should set the $gecos_mask to
a regular expression that will match the whole name so NeoMutt will expand
"Franklin" to "Franklin, Steve".


.TP
.B group_index_format
.nf
Type: string
Default: "%4C %M%N %5s  %\-45.45f %d"
.fi
.IP
This variable allows you to customize the newsgroup browser display to
your personal taste.  This string is similar to "index_format", but
has its own set of printf()\-like sequences:
.RS
.PD 0
.TP
%C  
Current newsgroup number
.TP
%d  
Description of newsgroup (becomes from server)
.TP
%f  
Newsgroup name
.TP
%M  
\- if newsgroup not allowed for direct post (moderated for example)
.TP
%N  
N if newsgroup is new, u if unsubscribed, blank otherwise
.TP
%n  
Number of new articles in newsgroup
.TP
%s  
Number of unread articles in newsgroup

.TP
.B hdrs
.nf
Type: boolean
Default: yes
.fi
.IP
When \fIunset\fP, the header fields normally added by the "my_hdr"
command are not created.  This variable \fImust\fP be unset before
composing a new message or replying in order to take effect.  If \fIset\fP,
the user defined header fields are added to every new message.


.TP
.B header
.nf
Type: boolean
Default: no
.fi
.IP
When \fIset\fP, this variable causes NeoMutt to include the header
of the message you are replying to into the edit buffer.
The $weed setting applies.


.TP
.B header_cache
.nf
Type: path
Default: ""
.fi
.IP
This variable points to the header cache database. If the path points to
an existing directory, NeoMutt will create a dedicated header cache
database per folder. Otherwise, the path points to a regular file, which
will be created as needed and used as a shared global header cache for
all folders.
By default it is \fIunset\fP so no header caching will be used.
.IP
Header caching can greatly improve speed when opening POP, IMAP
MH or Maildir folders, see "caching" for details.


.TP
.B header_cache_backend
.nf
Type: string
Default: ""
.fi
.IP
This variable specifies the header cache backend.  By default it is
\fIunset\fP so no header caching will be used.


.TP
.B header_cache_compress_level
.nf
Type: number
Default: 1
.fi
.IP
When NeoMutt is compiled with lz4, zstd or zlib, this option can be used
to setup the compression level.


.TP
.B header_cache_compress_method
.nf
Type: string
Default: ""
.fi
.IP
When NeoMutt is compiled with lz4, zstd or zlib, the header cache backend
can use these compression methods for compressing the cache files.
This results in much smaller cache file sizes and may even improve speed.


.TP
.B header_color_partial
.nf
Type: boolean
Default: no
.fi
.IP
When \fIset\fP, color header regexes behave like color body regexes:
color is applied to the exact text matched by the regex.  When
\fIunset\fP, color is applied to the entire header.
.IP
One use of this option might be to apply color to just the header labels.
.IP
See "color" for more details.


.TP
.B help
.nf
Type: boolean
Default: yes
.fi
.IP
When \fIset\fP, help lines describing the bindings for the major functions
provided by each menu are displayed on the first line of the screen.
.IP
\fBNote:\fP The binding will not be displayed correctly if the
function is bound to a sequence rather than a single keystroke.  Also,
the help line may not be updated if a binding is changed while NeoMutt is
running.  Since this variable is primarily aimed at new users, neither
of these should present a major problem.


.TP
.B hidden_host
.nf
Type: boolean
Default: no
.fi
.IP
When \fIset\fP, NeoMutt will skip the host name part of $hostname variable
when adding the domain part to addresses.  This variable does not
affect the generation of Message\-IDs, and it will not lead to the
cut\-off of first\-level domains.


.TP
.B hidden_tags
.nf
Type: string list
Default: "unread,draft,flagged,passed,replied,attachment,signed,encrypted"
.fi
.IP
This variable specifies private notmuch/imap tags which should not be printed
on screen.


.TP
.B hide_limited
.nf
Type: boolean
Default: no
.fi
.IP
When \fIset\fP, NeoMutt will not show the presence of messages that are hidden
by limiting, in the thread tree.


.TP
.B hide_missing
.nf
Type: boolean
Default: yes
.fi
.IP
When \fIset\fP, NeoMutt will not show the presence of missing messages in the
thread tree.


.TP
.B hide_thread_subject
.nf
Type: boolean
Default: yes
.fi
.IP
When \fIset\fP, NeoMutt will not show the subject of messages in the thread
tree that have the same subject as their parent or closest previously
displayed sibling.


.TP
.B hide_top_limited
.nf
Type: boolean
Default: no
.fi
.IP
When \fIset\fP, NeoMutt will not show the presence of messages that are hidden
by limiting, at the top of threads in the thread tree.  Note that when
$hide_limited is \fIset\fP, this option will have no effect.


.TP
.B hide_top_missing
.nf
Type: boolean
Default: yes
.fi
.IP
When \fIset\fP, NeoMutt will not show the presence of missing messages at the
top of threads in the thread tree.  Note that when $hide_missing is
\fIset\fP, this option will have no effect.


.TP
.B history
.nf
Type: number
Default: 10
.fi
.IP
This variable controls the size (in number of strings remembered) of
the string history buffer per category. The buffer is cleared each time the
variable is set.


.TP
.B history_file
.nf
Type: path
Default: "~/.mutthistory"
.fi
.IP
The file in which NeoMutt will save its history.
.IP
Also see $save_history.


.TP
.B history_remove_dups
.nf
Type: boolean
Default: no
.fi
.IP
When \fIset\fP, all of the string history will be scanned for duplicates
when a new entry is added.  Duplicate entries in the $history_file will
also be removed when it is periodically compacted.


.TP
.B honor_disposition
.nf
Type: boolean
Default: no
.fi
.IP
When \fIset\fP, NeoMutt will not display attachments with a
disposition of "attachment" inline even if it could
render the part to plain text. These MIME parts can only
be viewed from the attachment menu.
.IP
If \fIunset\fP, NeoMutt will render all MIME parts it can
properly transform to plain text.


.TP
.B honor_followup_to
.nf
Type: quadoption
Default: yes
.fi
.IP
This variable controls whether or not a Mail\-Followup\-To header is
honored when group\-replying to a message.


.TP
.B hostname
.nf
Type: string
Default: ""
.fi
.IP
Specifies the fully\-qualified hostname of the system NeoMutt is running on
containing the host's name and the DNS domain it belongs to. It is used
as the domain part (after "@") for local email addresses as well as
Message\-Id headers.
.IP
If not specified in a config file, then NeoMutt will try to determine the hostname itself.
.IP
Optionally, NeoMutt can be compiled with a fixed domain name.
.IP
Also see $use_domain and $hidden_host.


.TP
.B idn_decode
.nf
Type: boolean
Default: yes
.fi
.IP
When \fIset\fP, NeoMutt will show you international domain names decoded.
Note: You can use IDNs for addresses even if this is \fIunset\fP.
This variable only affects decoding. (IDN only)


.TP
.B idn_encode
.nf
Type: boolean
Default: yes
.fi
.IP
When \fIset\fP, NeoMutt will encode international domain names using
IDN.  Unset this if your SMTP server can handle newer (RFC6531)
UTF\-8 encoded domains. (IDN only)


.TP
.B ignore_list_reply_to
.nf
Type: boolean
Default: no
.fi
.IP
Affects the behavior of the \fC<reply>\fP function when replying to
messages from mailing lists (as defined by the "subscribe" or
"lists" commands).  When \fIset\fP, if the "Reply\-To:" field is
set to the same value as the "To:" field, NeoMutt assumes that the
"Reply\-To:" field was set by the mailing list to automate responses
to the list, and will ignore this field.  To direct a response to the
mailing list when this option is \fIset\fP, use the \fC<list-reply>\fP
function; \fC<group\-reply>\fP will reply to both the sender and the
list.


.TP
.B imap_authenticators
.nf
Type: string list
Default: ""
.fi
.IP
This is a colon\-delimited list of authentication methods NeoMutt may
attempt to use to log in to an IMAP server, in the order NeoMutt should
try them.  Authentication methods are either "login" or the right
side of an IMAP "AUTH=xxx" capability string, e.g. "digest\-md5", "gssapi"
or "cram\-md5". This option is case\-insensitive. If it's
\fIunset\fP (the default) NeoMutt will try all available methods,
in order from most\-secure to least\-secure.
.IP
Example:

.IP
.EX
set imap_authenticators="gssapi:cram\-md5:login"

.EE
.IP
\fBNote:\fP NeoMutt will only fall back to other authentication methods if
the previous methods are unavailable. If a method is available but
authentication fails, NeoMutt will not connect to the IMAP server.


.TP
.B imap_check_subscribed
.nf
Type: boolean
Default: no
.fi
.IP
When \fIset\fP, NeoMutt will fetch the set of subscribed folders from
your server whenever a mailbox is \fBselected\fP, and add them to the set
of mailboxes it polls for new mail just as if you had issued individual
"mailboxes" commands.


.TP
.B imap_condstore
.nf
Type: boolean
Default: no
.fi
.IP
When \fIset\fP, NeoMutt will use the CONDSTORE extension (RFC7162)
if advertised by the server.  NeoMutt's current implementation is basic,
used only for initial message fetching and flag updates.
.IP
For some IMAP servers, enabling this will slightly speed up
downloading initial messages.  Unfortunately, Gmail is not one
those, and displays worse performance when enabled.  Your
mileage may vary.


.TP
.B imap_deflate
.nf
Type: boolean
Default: yes
.fi
.IP
When \fIset\fP, NeoMutt will use the COMPRESS=DEFLATE extension (RFC4978)
if advertised by the server.
.IP
In general a good compression efficiency can be achieved, which
speeds up reading large mailboxes also on fairly good connections.


.TP
.B imap_delim_chars
.nf
Type: string
Default: "/."
.fi
.IP
This contains the list of characters that NeoMutt will use as folder
separators for IMAP paths, when no separator is provided on the IMAP
connection.


.TP
.B imap_fetch_chunk_size
.nf
Type: number (long)
Default: 0
.fi
.IP
When set to a value greater than 0, new headers will be
downloaded in groups of this many headers per request.  If you
have a very large mailbox, this might prevent a timeout and
disconnect when opening the mailbox, by sending a FETCH per set
of this many headers, instead of a single FETCH for all new
headers.


.TP
.B imap_headers
.nf
Type: string
Default: ""
.fi
.IP
NeoMutt requests these header fields in addition to the default headers
("Date:", "From:", "Sender:", "Subject:", "To:", "Cc:", "Message\-Id:",
"References:", "Content\-Type:", "Content\-Description:", "In\-Reply\-To:",
"Reply\-To:", "Lines:", "List\-Post:", "X\-Label:") from IMAP
servers before displaying the index menu. You may want to add more
headers for spam detection.
.IP
\fBNote:\fP This is a space separated list, items should be uppercase
and not contain the colon, e.g. "X\-BOGOSITY X\-SPAM\-STATUS" for the
"X\-Bogosity:" and "X\-Spam\-Status:" header fields.


.TP
.B imap_idle
.nf
Type: boolean
Default: no
.fi
.IP
When \fIset\fP, NeoMutt will attempt to use the IMAP IDLE extension
to check for new mail in the current mailbox. Some servers
(dovecot was the inspiration for this option) react badly
to NeoMutt's implementation. If your connection seems to freeze
up periodically, try unsetting this.


.TP
.B imap_keepalive
.nf
Type: number
Default: 300
.fi
.IP
This variable specifies the maximum amount of time in seconds that NeoMutt
will wait before polling open IMAP connections, to prevent the server
from closing them before NeoMutt has finished with them. The default is
well within the RFC\-specified minimum amount of time (30 minutes) before
a server is allowed to do this, but in practice the RFC does get
violated every now and then. Reduce this number if you find yourself
getting disconnected from your IMAP server due to inactivity.


.TP
.B imap_list_subscribed
.nf
Type: boolean
Default: no
.fi
.IP
This variable configures whether IMAP folder browsing will look for
only subscribed folders or all folders.  This can be toggled in the
IMAP browser with the \fC<toggle\-subscribed>\fP function.


.TP
.B imap_login
.nf
Type: string
Default: ""
.fi
.IP
Your login name on the IMAP server.
.IP
This variable defaults to the value of $imap_user.


.TP
.B imap_oauth_refresh_command
.nf
Type: command
Default: ""
.fi
.IP
The command to run to generate an OAUTH refresh token for
authorizing your connection to your IMAP server.  This command will be
run on every connection attempt that uses the OAUTHBEARER authentication
mechanism.  See "oauth" for details.


.TP
.B imap_pass
.nf
Type: string
Default: ""
.fi
.IP
Specifies the password for your IMAP account.  If \fIunset\fP, NeoMutt will
prompt you for your password when you invoke the \fC<imap\-fetch\-mail>\fP function
or try to open an IMAP folder.
.IP
\fBWarning\fP: you should only use this option when you are on a
fairly secure machine, because the superuser can read your neomuttrc even
if you are the only one who can read the file.


.TP
.B imap_passive
.nf
Type: boolean
Default: yes
.fi
.IP
When \fIset\fP, NeoMutt will not open new IMAP connections to check for new
mail.  NeoMutt will only check for new mail over existing IMAP
connections.  This is useful if you don't want to be prompted for
user/password pairs on NeoMutt invocation, or if opening the connection
is slow.


.TP
.B imap_peek
.nf
Type: boolean
Default: yes
.fi
.IP
When \fIset\fP, NeoMutt will avoid implicitly marking your mail as read whenever
you fetch a message from the server. This is generally a good thing,
but can make closing an IMAP folder somewhat slower. This option
exists to appease speed freaks.


.TP
.B imap_pipeline_depth
.nf
Type: number
Default: 15
.fi
.IP
Controls the number of IMAP commands that may be queued up before they
are sent to the server. A deeper pipeline reduces the amount of time
NeoMutt must wait for the server, and can make IMAP servers feel much
more responsive. But not all servers correctly handle pipelined commands,
so if you have problems you might want to try setting this variable to 0.
.IP
\fBNote:\fP Changes to this variable have no effect on open connections.


.TP
.B imap_poll_timeout
.nf
Type: number
Default: 15
.fi
.IP
This variable specifies the maximum amount of time in seconds
that NeoMutt will wait for a response when polling IMAP connections
for new mail, before timing out and closing the connection.  Set
to 0 to disable timing out.


.TP
.B imap_qresync
.nf
Type: boolean
Default: no
.fi
.IP
When \fIset\fP, NeoMutt will use the QRESYNC extension (RFC7162)
if advertised by the server.  NeoMutt's current implementation is basic,
used only for initial message fetching and flag updates.
.IP
Note: this feature is currently experimental.  If you experience
strange behavior, such as duplicate or missing messages please
file a bug report to let us know.


.TP
.B imap_rfc5161
.nf
Type: boolean
Default: yes
.fi
.IP
When \fIset\fP, NeoMutt will use the IMAP ENABLE extension (RFC5161) to
select CAPABILITIES. Some servers (notably Coremail System IMap Server) do
not properly respond to ENABLE commands, which might cause NeoMutt to hang.
If your connection seems to freeze at login, try unsetting this. See also
https://github.com/neomutt/neomutt/issues/1689


.TP
.B imap_servernoise
.nf
Type: boolean
Default: yes
.fi
.IP
When \fIset\fP, NeoMutt will display warning messages from the IMAP
server as error messages. Since these messages are often
harmless, or generated due to configuration problems on the
server which are out of the users' hands, you may wish to suppress
them at some point.


.TP
.B imap_user
.nf
Type: string
Default: ""
.fi
.IP
The name of the user whose mail you intend to access on the IMAP
server.
.IP
This variable defaults to your user name on the local machine.


.TP
.B implicit_autoview
.nf
Type: boolean
Default: no
.fi
.IP
If set to "yes", NeoMutt will look for a mailcap entry with the
"\fCcopiousoutput\fP" flag set for \fIevery\fP MIME attachment it doesn't have
an internal viewer defined for.  If such an entry is found, NeoMutt will
use the viewer defined in that entry to convert the body part to text
form.


.TP
.B include
.nf
Type: quadoption
Default: ask\-yes
.fi
.IP
Controls whether or not a copy of the message(s) you are replying to
is included in your reply.


.TP
.B include_encrypted
.nf
Type: boolean
Default: no
.fi
.IP
Controls whether or not NeoMutt includes separately encrypted attachment
contents when replying.
.IP
This variable was added to prevent accidental exposure of encrypted
contents when replying to an attacker.  If a previously encrypted message
were attached by the attacker, they could trick an unwary recipient into
decrypting and including the message in their reply.


.TP
.B include_onlyfirst
.nf
Type: boolean
Default: no
.fi
.IP
Controls whether or not NeoMutt includes only the first attachment
of the message you are replying.


.TP
.B indent_string
.nf
Type: string
Default: "> "
.fi
.IP
Specifies the string to prepend to each line of text quoted in a
message to which you are replying.  You are strongly encouraged not to
change this value, as it tends to agitate the more fanatical netizens.
.IP
The value of this option is ignored if $text_flowed is set, because
the quoting mechanism is strictly defined for format=flowed.
.IP
This option is a format string, please see the description of
$index_format for supported \fCprintf(3)\fP\-style sequences.


.TP
.B index_format
.nf
Type: string
Default: "%4C %Z %{%b %d} %\-15.15L (%?l?%4l&%4c?) %s"
.fi
.IP
This variable allows you to customize the message index display to
your personal taste.
.IP
"Format strings" are similar to the strings used in the C
function \fCprintf(3)\fP to format output (see the man page for more details).
For an explanation of the %? construct, see the status_format description.

Date format expressions can be constructed based on relative dates. Using
the date formatting operators along with nested conditionals, the date
format can be modified based on how old a message is.  See the section on
"Conditional Dates" for an explanation and examples
.IP
Note that for mbox/mmdf, "%l" applies to the unprocessed message, and
for maildir/mh, the value comes from the "Lines:" header field when
present (the meaning is normally the same). Thus the value depends on
the encodings used in the different parts of the message and has little
meaning in practice.
.IP
"Soft\-fill" deserves some explanation: Normal right\-justification
will print everything to the left of the "%>", displaying padding and
whatever lies to the right only if there's room. By contrast,
soft\-fill gives priority to the right\-hand side, guaranteeing space
to display it and showing padding only if there's still room. If
necessary, soft\-fill will eat text leftwards to make room for
rightward text.
.IP
Note that these expandos are supported in
"save-hook", "fcc-hook" and "fcc-save-hook", too.


.TP
.B inews
.nf

.fi
.IP
How to invoke ispell (GNU's spell\-checking software).


.TP
.B keep_flagged
.nf
Type: boolean
Default: no
.fi
.IP
If \fIset\fP, read messages marked as flagged will not be moved
from your spool mailbox to your $mbox mailbox, or as a result of
a "mbox-hook" command.


.TP
.B mail_check
.nf
Type: number
Default: 5
.fi
.IP
This variable configures how often (in seconds) NeoMutt should look for
new mail. Also see the $timeout variable.


.TP
.B mail_check_recent
.nf
Type: boolean
Default: yes
.fi
.IP
When \fIset\fP, NeoMutt will only notify you about new mail that has been received
since the last time you opened the mailbox.  When \fIunset\fP, NeoMutt will notify you
if any new mail exists in the mailbox, regardless of whether you have visited it
recently.
.IP
When \fI$mark_old\fP is set, NeoMutt does not consider the mailbox to contain new
mail if only old messages exist.


.TP
.B mail_check_stats
.nf
Type: boolean
Default: no
.fi
.IP
When \fIset\fP, NeoMutt will periodically calculate message
statistics of a mailbox while polling for new mail.  It will
check for unread, flagged, and total message counts.  Because
this operation is more performance intensive, it defaults to
\fIunset\fP, and has a separate option, $mail_check_stats_interval, to
control how often to update these counts.
.IP
Message statistics can also be explicitly calculated by invoking the
\fC<check\-stats>\fP function.


.TP
.B mail_check_stats_interval
.nf
Type: number
Default: 60
.fi
.IP
When $mail_check_stats is \fIset\fP, this variable configures
how often (in seconds) NeoMutt will update message counts.


.TP
.B mailcap_path
.nf
Type: string list
Default: "~/.mailcap:/usr/share/neomutt/mailcap:/etc/mailcap:/etc/mailcap:/usr/etc/mailcap:/usr/local/etc/mailcap"
.fi
.IP
This variable specifies which files to consult when attempting to
display MIME bodies not directly supported by NeoMutt.  The default value
is generated during startup: see the "mailcap" section of the manual.
.IP
$mailcap_path is overridden by the environment variable \fC$MAILCAPS\fP.
.IP
The default search path is from RFC1524.


.TP
.B mailcap_sanitize
.nf
Type: boolean
Default: yes
.fi
.IP
If \fIset\fP, NeoMutt will restrict possible characters in mailcap % expandos
to a well\-defined set of safe characters.  This is the safe setting,
but we are not sure it doesn't break some more advanced MIME stuff.
.IP
\fBDON'T CHANGE THIS SETTING UNLESS YOU ARE REALLY SURE WHAT YOU ARE
DOING!\fP


.TP
.B maildir_check_cur
.nf
Type: boolean
Default: no
.fi
.IP
If \fIset\fP, NeoMutt will poll both the new and cur directories of
a maildir folder for new messages.  This might be useful if other
programs interacting with the folder (e.g. dovecot) are moving new
messages to the cur directory.  Note that setting this option may
slow down polling for new messages in large folders, since NeoMutt has
to scan all cur messages.


.TP
.B maildir_header_cache_verify
.nf
Type: boolean
Default: yes
.fi
.IP
Check for Maildir unaware programs other than NeoMutt having modified maildir
files when the header cache is in use.  This incurs one \fCstat(2)\fP per
message every time the folder is opened (which can be very slow for NFS
folders).


.TP
.B maildir_trash
.nf
Type: boolean
Default: no
.fi
.IP
If \fIset\fP, messages marked as deleted will be saved with the maildir
trashed flag instead of unlinked.  \fBNote:\fP this only applies
to maildir\-style mailboxes.  Setting it will have no effect on other
mailbox types.


.TP
.B mark_macro_prefix
.nf
Type: string
Default: "'"
.fi
.IP
Prefix for macros created using mark\-message.  A new macro
automatically generated with \fI<mark\-message>a\fP will be composed
from this prefix and the letter \fIa\fP.


.TP
.B mark_old
.nf
Type: boolean
Default: yes
.fi
.IP
Controls whether or not NeoMutt marks \fInew\fP \fBunread\fP
messages as \fIold\fP if you exit a mailbox without reading them.
With this option \fIset\fP, the next time you start NeoMutt, the messages
will show up with an "O" next to them in the index menu,
indicating that they are old.


.TP
.B markers
.nf
Type: boolean
Default: yes
.fi
.IP
Controls the display of wrapped lines in the internal pager. If set, a
"+" marker is displayed at the beginning of wrapped lines.
.IP
Also see the $smart_wrap variable.


.TP
.B mask
.nf
Type: regular expression
Default: "!^\\.[^.]"
.fi
.IP
A regular expression used in the file browser, optionally preceded by
the \fInot\fP operator "!".  Only files whose names match this mask
will be shown. The match is always case\-sensitive.


.TP
.B mbox
.nf
Type: mailbox
Default: "~/mbox"
.fi
.IP
This specifies the folder into which read mail in your $spoolfile
folder will be appended.
.IP
Also see the $move variable.


.TP
.B mbox_type
.nf
Type: enumeration
Default: mbox
.fi
.IP
The default mailbox type used when creating new folders. May be any of
"mbox", "MMDF", "MH" or "Maildir".
.IP
This can also be set using the \fC\-m\fP command\-line option.


.TP
.B menu_context
.nf
Type: number
Default: 0
.fi
.IP
This variable controls the number of lines of context that are given
when scrolling through menus. (Similar to $pager_context.)


.TP
.B menu_move_off
.nf
Type: boolean
Default: yes
.fi
.IP
When \fIunset\fP, the bottom entry of menus will never scroll up past
the bottom of the screen, unless there are less entries than lines.
When \fIset\fP, the bottom entry may move off the bottom.


.TP
.B menu_scroll
.nf
Type: boolean
Default: no
.fi
.IP
When \fIset\fP, menus will be scrolled up or down one line when you
attempt to move across a screen boundary.  If \fIunset\fP, the screen
is cleared and the next or previous page of the menu is displayed
(useful for slow links to avoid many redraws).


.TP
.B message_cache_clean
.nf
Type: boolean
Default: no
.fi
.IP
If \fIset\fP, NeoMutt will clean out obsolete entries from the message cache when
the mailbox is synchronized. You probably only want to set it
every once in a while, since it can be a little slow
(especially for large folders).


.TP
.B message_cachedir
.nf
Type: path
Default: ""
.fi
.IP
Set this to a directory and NeoMutt will cache copies of messages from
your IMAP and POP servers here. You are free to remove entries at any
time.
.IP
When setting this variable to a directory, NeoMutt needs to fetch every
remote message only once and can perform regular expression searches
as fast as for local folders.
.IP
Also see the $message_cache_clean variable.


.TP
.B message_format
.nf
Type: string
Default: "%s"
.fi
.IP
This is the string displayed in the "attachment" menu for
attachments of type \fCmessage/rfc822\fP.  For a full listing of defined
\fCprintf(3)\fP\-like sequences see the section on $index_format.


.TP
.B meta_key
.nf
Type: boolean
Default: no
.fi
.IP
If \fIset\fP, forces NeoMutt to interpret keystrokes with the high bit (bit 8)
set as if the user had pressed the Esc key and whatever key remains
after having the high bit removed.  For example, if the key pressed
has an ASCII value of \fC0xf8\fP, then this is treated as if the user had
pressed Esc then "x".  This is because the result of removing the
high bit from \fC0xf8\fP is \fC0x78\fP, which is the ASCII character
"x".


.TP
.B metoo
.nf
Type: boolean
Default: no
.fi
.IP
If \fIunset\fP, NeoMutt will remove your address (see the "alternates"
command) from the list of recipients when replying to a message.


.TP
.B mh_purge
.nf
Type: boolean
Default: no
.fi
.IP
When \fIunset\fP, NeoMutt will mimic mh's behavior and rename deleted messages
to \fI,<old file name>\fP in mh folders instead of really deleting
them. This leaves the message on disk but makes programs reading the folder
ignore it. If the variable is \fIset\fP, the message files will simply be
deleted.
.IP
This option is similar to $maildir_trash for Maildir folders.


.TP
.B mh_seq_flagged
.nf
Type: string
Default: "flagged"
.fi
.IP
The name of the MH sequence used for flagged messages.


.TP
.B mh_seq_replied
.nf
Type: string
Default: "replied"
.fi
.IP
The name of the MH sequence used to tag replied messages.


.TP
.B mh_seq_unseen
.nf
Type: string
Default: "unseen"
.fi
.IP
The name of the MH sequence used for unseen messages.


.TP
.B mime_forward
.nf
Type: quadoption
Default: no
.fi
.IP
When \fIset\fP, the message you are forwarding will be attached as a
separate \fCmessage/rfc822\fP MIME part instead of included in the main body of the
message.  This is useful for forwarding MIME messages so the receiver
can properly view the message as it was delivered to you. If you like
to switch between MIME and not MIME from mail to mail, set this
variable to "ask\-no" or "ask\-yes".
.IP
Also see $forward_decode and $mime_forward_decode.


.TP
.B mime_forward_decode
.nf
Type: boolean
Default: no
.fi
.IP
Controls the decoding of complex MIME messages into \fCtext/plain\fP when
forwarding a message while $mime_forward is \fIset\fP. Otherwise
$forward_decode is used instead.


.TP
.B mime_forward_rest
.nf
Type: quadoption
Default: yes
.fi
.IP
When forwarding multiple attachments of a MIME message from the attachment
menu, attachments which can't be decoded in a reasonable manner will
be attached to the newly composed message if this option is \fIset\fP.


.TP
.B mime_subject
.nf
Type: boolean
Default: yes
.fi
.IP
If \fIunset\fP, 8\-bit "subject:" line in article header will not be
encoded according to RFC2047 to base64.  This is useful when message
is Usenet article, because MIME for news is nonstandard feature.


.TP
.B mime_type_query_command
.nf
Type: command
Default: ""
.fi
.IP
This specifies a command to run, to determine the mime type of a
new attachment when composing a message.  Unless
$mime_type_query_first is set, this will only be run if the
attachment's extension is not found in the mime.types file.
.IP
The string may contain a "%s", which will be substituted with the
attachment filename.  NeoMutt will add quotes around the string substituted
for "%s" automatically according to shell quoting rules, so you should
avoid adding your own.  If no "%s" is found in the string, NeoMutt will
append the attachment filename to the end of the string.
.IP
The command should output a single line containing the
attachment's mime type.
.IP
Suggested values are "xdg\-mime query filetype" or
"file \-bi".


.TP
.B mime_type_query_first
.nf
Type: boolean
Default: no
.fi
.IP
When \fIset\fP, the $mime_type_query_command will be run before the
mime.types lookup.


.TP
.B mix_entry_format
.nf
Type: string
Default: "%4n %c %\-16s %a"

system.  It is used with various sets of parameters to gather the
list of known remailers, and to finally send a message through the
mixmaster chain.


.TP
.B move
.nf
Type: quadoption
Default: no
.fi
.IP
Controls whether or not NeoMutt will move read messages
from your spool mailbox to your $mbox mailbox, or as a result of
a "mbox-hook" command.


.TP
.B narrow_tree
.nf

.IP
Your login name on the NNTP server.  If \fIunset\fP and NNTP server requires
authentication, NeoMutt will prompt you for your account name when you
connect to news server.


.TP
.B pager
.nf
Type: command
Default: "builtin"
.fi
.IP
This variable specifies which pager you would like to use to view
messages. The value "builtin" means to use the built\-in pager, otherwise this
variable should specify the pathname of the external pager you would
like to use.
.IP
Using an external pager may have some disadvantages: Additional
keystrokes are necessary because you can't call NeoMutt functions
directly from the pager, and screen resizes cause lines longer than
the screen width to be badly formatted in the help menu.


.TP
.B pager_context
.nf
Type: number
Default: 0
.fi
.IP
This variable controls the number of lines of context that are given
when displaying the next or previous page in the internal pager.  By
default, NeoMutt will display the line after the last one on the screen
at the top of the next page (0 lines of context).
.IP
This variable also specifies the amount of context given for search
results. If positive, this many lines will be given before a match,
if 0, the match will be top\-aligned.


.TP
.B pager_format
.nf
Type: string
Default: "\-%Z\- %C/%m: %\-20.20n   %s%*  \-\- (%P)"

displayed before each message in either the internal or an external
pager.  The valid sequences are listed in the $index_format
section.


.TP
.B pager_index_lines
.nf
Type: number
Default: 0
.fi
.IP
Determines the number of lines of a mini\-index which is shown when in
the pager.  The current message, unless near the top or bottom of the
folder, will be roughly one third of the way down this mini\-index,
giving the reader the context of a few messages before and after the
message.  This is useful, for example, to determine how many messages
remain to be read in the current thread.  A value of 0 results in no index
being shown.  If the number of messages in the current folder is less than
$pager_index_lines, then the index will only use as many lines as it needs.


.TP
.B pager_stop
.nf
Type: boolean
Default: no

.B pgp_autoinline
.nf
Type: boolean
Default: no
.fi
.IP
This option controls whether NeoMutt generates old\-style inline
(traditional) PGP encrypted or signed messages under certain
circumstances.  This can be overridden by use of the pgp menu,
when inline is not required.  The GPGME backend does not support
this option.

Note that NeoMutt might automatically use PGP/MIME for messages
which consist of more than a single MIME part.  NeoMutt can be
configured to ask before sending PGP/MIME messages when inline
(traditional) would not work.

Setting this variable will cause NeoMutt to always attempt to
create an inline (traditional) message when replying to a
message which is PGP encrypted/signed inline.  This can be
overridden by use of the pgp menu, when inline is not
required.  This option does not automatically detect if the

* = can be optionally printed if nonzero, see the $status_format documentation.


.TP
.B quit
.nf
Type: quadoption
Default: yes
.fi
.IP
This variable controls whether "quit" and "exit" actually quit
from NeoMutt.  If this option is \fIset\fP, they do quit, if it is \fIunset\fP, they
have no effect, and if it is set to \fIask\-yes\fP or \fIask\-no\fP, you are
prompted for confirmation when you try to quit.


.TP
.B quote_regex
.nf
Type: regular expression
Default: "^([ \\t]*[|>:}#])+"
.fi
.IP
A regular expression used in the internal pager to determine quoted
sections of text in the body of a message. Quoted text may be filtered
out using the \fC<toggle\-quoted>\fP command, or colored according to the
"color quoted" family of directives.
.IP
Higher levels of quoting may be colored differently ("color quoted1",
"color quoted2", etc.). The quoting level is determined by removing
the last character from the matched text and recursively reapplying
the regular expression until it fails to produce a match.
.IP
Match detection may be overridden by the $smileys regular expression.


.TP
.B read_inc
.nf
Type: number
Default: 10
.fi
.IP
If set to a value greater than 0, NeoMutt will display which message it
is currently on when reading a mailbox or when performing search actions
such as search and limit. The message is printed after
this many messages have been read or searched (e.g., if set to 25, NeoMutt will
print a message when it is at message 25, and then again when it gets
to message 50).  This variable is meant to indicate progress when
reading or searching large mailboxes which may take some time.
When set to 0, only a single message will appear before the reading
the mailbox.
.IP
Also see the $write_inc, $net_inc and $time_inc variables and the
"tuning" section of the manual for performance considerations.


.TP
.B read_only
.nf
Type: boolean
Default: no
.fi
.IP
If \fIset\fP, all folders are opened in read\-only mode.


.TP
.B realname
.nf
Type: string
Default: ""
.fi
.IP
This variable specifies what "real" or "personal" name should be used
when sending messages.
.IP
If not specified, then the user's "real name" will be read from \fC/etc/passwd\fP.
This option will not be used, if "$from" is set.


.TP
.B recall
.nf
Type: quadoption
Default: ask\-yes
.fi
.IP
Controls whether or not NeoMutt recalls postponed messages
when composing a new message.
.IP
Setting this variable to \fIyes\fP is not generally useful, and thus not
recommended.  Note that the \fC<recall\-message>\fP function can be used
to manually recall postponed messages.
.IP
Also see $postponed variable.


.TP
.B record
.nf
Type: mailbox
Default: "~/sent"
.fi
.IP
This specifies the file into which your outgoing messages should be
appended.  (This is meant as the primary method for saving a copy of
your messages, but another way to do this is using the "my_hdr"
command to create a "Bcc:" field with your email address in it.)
.IP
The value of \fI$record\fP is overridden by the $force_name and
$save_name variables, and the "fcc-hook" command.  Also see $copy
and $write_bcc.


.TP
.B reflow_space_quotes
.nf
Type: boolean
Default: yes
.fi
.IP
This option controls how quotes from format=flowed messages are displayed
in the pager and when replying (with $text_flowed \fIunset\fP).
When set, this option adds spaces after each level of quote marks, turning
">>>foo" into "> > > foo".
.IP
\fBNote:\fP If $reflow_text is \fIunset\fP, this option has no effect.
Also, this option does not affect replies when $text_flowed is \fIset\fP.


.TP
.B reflow_text
.nf
Type: boolean
Default: yes
.fi
.IP
When \fIset\fP, NeoMutt will reformat paragraphs in text/plain
parts marked format=flowed.  If \fIunset\fP, NeoMutt will display paragraphs
unaltered from how they appear in the message body.  See RFC3676 for
details on the \fIformat=flowed\fP format.
.IP
Also see $reflow_wrap, and $wrap.


.TP
.B reflow_wrap
.nf
Type: number
Default: 78
.fi
.IP
This variable controls the maximum paragraph width when reformatting text/plain
parts when $reflow_text is \fIset\fP.  When the value is 0, paragraphs will
be wrapped at the terminal's right margin.  A positive value sets the
paragraph width relative to the left margin.  A negative value set the
paragraph width relative to the right margin.
.IP
Also see $wrap.


.TP
.B reply_regex
.nf
Type: regular expression
Default: "^((re|aw|sv)(\\[[0\-9]+\\])*:[ \\t]*)*"
.fi
.IP
A regular expression used to recognize reply messages when threading
and replying. The default value corresponds to the English "Re:", the
German "Aw:" and the Swedish "Sv:".


.TP
.B reply_self
.nf
Type: boolean
Default: no
.fi
.IP
If \fIunset\fP and you are replying to a message sent by you, NeoMutt will
assume that you want to reply to the recipients of that message rather
than to yourself.
.IP
Also see the "alternates" command.


.TP
.B reply_to
.nf
Type: quadoption
Default: ask\-yes
.fi
.IP
If \fIset\fP, when replying to a message, NeoMutt will use the address listed
in the Reply\-to: header as the recipient of the reply.  If \fIunset\fP,
it will use the address in the From: header field instead.  This
option is useful for reading a mailing list that sets the Reply\-To:
header field to the list address and you want to send a private
message to the author of a message.


.TP
.B reply_with_xorig
.nf
Type: boolean
Default: no
.fi
.IP
This variable provides a toggle. When active, the From: header will be
extracted from the current mail's 'X\-Original\-To:' header. This setting
does not have precedence over "reverse_realname".
.IP
Assuming 'fast_reply' is disabled, this option will prompt the user with a
prefilled From: header.


.TP
.B resolve
.nf
Type: boolean
Default: yes
.fi
.IP
When \fIset\fP, the cursor will be automatically advanced to the next
(possibly undeleted) message whenever a command that modifies the
current message is executed.


.TP
.B resume_draft_files
.nf
Type: boolean
Default: no
.fi
.IP
If \fIset\fP, draft files (specified by \fC\-H\fP on the command
line) are processed similarly to when resuming a postponed
message.  Recipients are not prompted for; send\-hooks are not
evaluated; no alias expansion takes place; user\-defined headers
and signatures are not added to the message.


.TP
.B resume_edited_draft_files
.nf
Type: boolean
Default: yes
.fi
.IP
If \fIset\fP, draft files previously edited (via \fC\-E \-H\fP on
the command line) will have $resume_draft_files automatically
set when they are used as a draft file again.
.IP
The first time a draft file is saved, NeoMutt will add a header,
X\-Mutt\-Resume\-Draft to the saved file.  The next time the draft
file is read in, if NeoMutt sees the header, it will set
$resume_draft_files.
.IP
This option is designed to prevent multiple signatures,
user\-defined headers, and other processing effects from being
made multiple times to the draft file.


.TP
.B reverse_alias
.nf
Type: boolean
Default: no
.fi
.IP
This variable controls whether or not NeoMutt will display the "personal"
name from your aliases in the index menu if it finds an alias that
matches the message's sender.  For example, if you have the following
alias:

.IP
.EX
alias juser abd30425@somewhere.net (Joe User)

.EE
.IP
and then you receive mail which contains the following header:

.IP
.EX
From: abd30425@somewhere.net

.EE
.IP
It would be displayed in the index menu as "Joe User" instead of
"abd30425@somewhere.net."  This is useful when the person's e\-mail
address is not human friendly.


.TP
.B reverse_name
.nf
Type: boolean
Default: no
.fi
.IP
It may sometimes arrive that you receive mail to a certain machine,
move the messages to another machine, and reply to some the messages
from there.  If this variable is \fIset\fP, the default \fIFrom:\fP line of
the reply messages is built using the address where you received the
messages you are replying to \fBif\fP that address matches your
"alternates".  If the variable is \fIunset\fP, or the address that would be
used doesn't match your "alternates", the \fIFrom:\fP line will use
your address on the current machine.
.IP
Also see the "alternates" command and $reverse_realname.


.TP
.B reverse_realname
.nf
Type: boolean
Default: yes
.fi
.IP
This variable fine\-tunes the behavior of the $reverse_name feature.
.IP
When it is \fIunset\fP, NeoMutt will remove the real name part of a
matching address.  This allows the use of the email address
without having to also use what the sender put in the real name
field.
.IP
When it is \fIset\fP, NeoMutt will use the matching address as\-is.
.IP
In either case, a missing real name will be filled in afterwards
using the value of $realname.


.TP
.B rfc2047_parameters
.nf
Type: boolean
Default: no
.fi
.IP
When this variable is \fIset\fP, NeoMutt will decode RFC2047\-encoded MIME
parameters. You want to set this variable when NeoMutt suggests you
to save attachments to files named like:

.IP
.EX
=?iso\-8859\-1?Q?file=5F=E4=5F991116=2Ezip?=
=?utf\-8?Q?z=C4=99ta.png?=

.EE
.IP
When this variable is \fIset\fP interactively, the change won't be
active until you change folders.
.IP
Note that this use of RFC2047's encoding is explicitly
prohibited by the standard, but nevertheless encountered in the
wild and produced by, e.g., Outlook.
.IP
Also note that setting this parameter will \fInot\fP have the effect
that NeoMutt \fIgenerates\fP this kind of encoding.  Instead, NeoMutt will
unconditionally use the encoding specified in RFC2231.


.TP
.B save_address
.nf
Type: boolean
Default: no
.fi
.IP
If \fIset\fP, NeoMutt will take the sender's full address when choosing a
default folder for saving a mail. If $save_name or $force_name
is \fIset\fP too, the selection of the Fcc folder will be changed as well.


.TP
.B save_empty
.nf
Type: boolean
Default: yes
.fi
.IP
When \fIunset\fP, mailboxes which contain no saved messages will be removed
when closed (the exception is $spoolfile which is never removed).
If \fIset\fP, mailboxes are never removed.
.IP
\fBNote:\fP This only applies to mbox and MMDF folders, NeoMutt does not
delete MH and Maildir directories.


.TP
.B save_history
.nf
Type: number
Default: 0
.fi
.IP
This variable controls the size of the history (per category) saved in the
$history_file file.


.TP
.B save_name
.nf
Type: boolean
Default: no
.fi
.IP
This variable controls how copies of outgoing messages are saved.
When \fIset\fP, a check is made to see if a mailbox specified by the
recipient address exists (this is done by searching for a mailbox in
the $folder directory with the \fIusername\fP part of the
recipient address).  If the mailbox exists, the outgoing message will
be saved to that mailbox, otherwise the message is saved to the
$record mailbox.
.IP
Also see the $force_name variable.


.TP
.B save_unsubscribed
.nf
Type: boolean
Default: no
.fi
.IP
When \fIset\fP, info about unsubscribed newsgroups will be saved into
"newsrc" file and into cache.


.TP
.B score
.nf
Type: boolean
Default: yes
.fi
.IP
When this variable is \fIunset\fP, scoring is turned off.  This can
be useful to selectively disable scoring for certain folders when the
$score_threshold_delete variable and related are used.


.TP
.B score_threshold_delete
.nf
Type: number
Default: \-1
.fi
.IP
Messages which have been assigned a score equal to or lower than the value
of this variable are automatically marked for deletion by NeoMutt.  Since
NeoMutt scores are always greater than or equal to zero, the default setting
of this variable will never mark a message for deletion.


.TP
.B score_threshold_flag
.nf
Type: number
Default: 9999
.fi
.IP
Messages which have been assigned a score greater than or equal to this
variable's value are automatically marked "flagged".


.TP
.B score_threshold_read
.nf
Type: number
Default: \-1
.fi
.IP
Messages which have been assigned a score equal to or lower than the value
of this variable are automatically marked as read by NeoMutt.  Since
NeoMutt scores are always greater than or equal to zero, the default setting
of this variable will never mark a message read.


.TP
.B search_context
.nf
Type: number
Default: 0
.fi
.IP
For the pager, this variable specifies the number of lines shown
before search results. By default, search results will be top\-aligned.


.TP
.B send_charset
.nf
Type: string
Default: "us\-ascii:iso\-8859\-1:utf\-8"
.fi
.IP
A colon\-delimited list of character sets for outgoing messages. NeoMutt will use the
first character set into which the text can be converted exactly.
If your $charset is not "iso\-8859\-1" and recipients may not
understand "UTF\-8", it is advisable to include in the list an
appropriate widely used standard character set (such as
"iso\-8859\-2", "koi8\-r" or "iso\-2022\-jp") either instead of or after
"iso\-8859\-1".
.IP
In case the text can't be converted into one of these exactly,
NeoMutt uses $charset as a fallback.


.TP
.B sendmail
.nf
Type: command
Default: "/usr/sbin/sendmail \-oem \-oi"
.fi
.IP
Specifies the program and arguments used to deliver mail sent by NeoMutt.
NeoMutt expects that the specified program interprets additional
arguments as recipient addresses.  NeoMutt appends all recipients after
adding a \fC\-\-\fP delimiter (if not already present).  Additional
flags, such as for $use_8bitmime, $use_envelope_from,
$dsn_notify, or $dsn_return will be added before the delimiter.
.IP
\fBSee also:\fP $write_bcc.


.TP
.B sendmail_wait
.nf
Type: number
Default: 0
.fi
.IP
Specifies the number of seconds to wait for the $sendmail process
to finish before giving up and putting delivery in the background.
.IP
NeoMutt interprets the value of this variable as follows:
.RS
.PD 0
.TP
>0 
number of seconds to wait for sendmail to finish before continuing
.TP
0  
wait forever for sendmail to finish
.TP
<0

.RE
.PD 1
.IP
Note that if you specify a value other than 0, the output of the child
process will be put in a temporary file.  If there is some error, you
will be informed as to where to find the output.


.TP
.B shell
.nf
Type: command
Default: "/bin/sh"
.fi
.IP
Command to use when spawning a subshell.
If not specified, then the user's login shell from \fC/etc/passwd\fP is used.


.TP
.B show_multipart_alternative
.nf
Type: string
Default: ""
.fi
.IP
When \fIset\fP to \fCinfo\fP, the multipart/alternative information is shown.
When \fIset\fP to \fCinline\fP, all of the alternatives are displayed.
When not set, the default behavior is to show only the chosen alternative.


.TP
.B show_new_news
.nf
Type: boolean
Default: yes
.fi
.IP
If \fIset\fP, news server will be asked for new newsgroups on entering
the browser.  Otherwise, it will be done only once for a news server.
Also controls whether or not number of new articles of subscribed
newsgroups will be then checked.


.TP
.B show_only_unread
.nf
Type: boolean
Default: no
.fi

If \fIset\fP, only subscribed newsgroups that contain unread articles
will be displayed in browser.


.TP
.B sidebar_component_depth
.nf
Type: number
Default: 0
.fi
.IP
By default the sidebar will show the mailbox's path, relative to the
$folder variable. This specifies the number of parent directories to hide
from display in the sidebar. For example: If a maildir is normally
displayed in the sidebar as dir1/dir2/dir3/maildir, setting
\fCsidebar_component_depth=2\fP will display it as dir3/maildir, having
truncated the 2 highest directories.

.B sig_dashes
.nf
Type: boolean
Default: yes
.fi
.IP
If \fIset\fP, a line containing "\-\- " (note the trailing space) will be inserted before your
$signature.  It is \fBstrongly\fP recommended that you not \fIunset\fP
this variable unless your signature contains just your name.  The
reason for this is because many software packages use "\-\- \\n" to
detect your signature.  For example, NeoMutt has the ability to highlight
the signature in a different color in the built\-in pager.


.TP
.B sig_on_top

.B signature
.nf
Type: path
Default: "~/.signature"

assumed that filename is a shell command and input should be read from
its standard output.


.TP
.B simple_search
.nf
Type: string
Default: "~f %s | ~s %s"
.fi
.IP
Specifies how NeoMutt should expand a simple search into a real search
pattern.  A simple search is one that does not contain any of the "~" pattern
operators.  See "patterns" for more information on search patterns.
.IP
For example, if you simply type "joe" at a search or limit prompt, NeoMutt

.nf
Type: number
Default: 1
.fi
.IP
Specifies time, in seconds, to pause while displaying certain informational

messages from the current folder.  The default is to pause one second, so
a value of zero for this option suppresses the pause.


.TP
.B smart_wrap
.nf
Type: boolean
Default: yes
.fi
.IP
Controls the display of lines longer than the screen width in the

\fIunset\fP, lines are simply wrapped at the screen edge. Also see the
$markers variable.


.TP
.B smileys
.nf
Type: regular expression
Default: "(>From )|(:[\-^]?[][)(><}{|/DP])"
.fi
.IP
The \fIpager\fP uses this variable to catch some common false

.TP
.B smime_certificates
.nf
Type: path
Default: ""

.IP
Since for S/MIME there is no pubring/secring as with PGP, NeoMutt has to handle
storage and retrieval of keys by itself. This is very basic right
now, and keys and certificates are stored in two different
directories, both named as the hash\-value retrieved from
OpenSSL. There is an index file which contains mailbox\-address
keyid pairs, and which can be manually edited. This option points to
the location of the certificates.

.B smtp_authenticators
.nf
Type: string list
Default: ""
.fi
.IP
This is a colon\-delimited list of authentication methods NeoMutt may
attempt to use to log in to an SMTP server, in the order NeoMutt should
try them.  Authentication methods are any SASL mechanism, e.g. "plain",
"digest\-md5", "gssapi" or "cram\-md5".
This option is case\-insensitive. If it is "unset"
(the default) NeoMutt will try all available methods, in order from
most\-secure to least\-secure. Support for the "plain" mechanism is
bundled; other mechanisms are provided by an external SASL library (look
for +USE_SASL in the output of neomutt \-v).
.IP
Example:

.IP
.EX
set smtp_authenticators="digest\-md5:cram\-md5"

.EE


.TP
.B smtp_oauth_refresh_command
.nf
Type: command
Default: ""
.fi
.IP
The command to run to generate an OAUTH refresh token for
authorizing your connection to your SMTP server.  This command will be
run on every connection attempt that uses the OAUTHBEARER authentication
mechanism.  See "oauth" for details.


.TP
.B smtp_pass
.nf
Type: string
Default: ""
.fi
.IP
Specifies the password for your SMTP account.  If \fIunset\fP, NeoMutt will
prompt you for your password when you first send mail via SMTP.
See $smtp_url to configure NeoMutt to send mail via SMTP.
.IP
\fBWarning\fP: you should only use this option when you are on a
fairly secure machine, because the superuser can read your neomuttrc even
if you are the only one who can read the file.


.TP
.B smtp_url
.nf
Type: string
Default: ""
.fi
.IP
Defines the SMTP smarthost where sent messages should relayed for
delivery. This should take the form of an SMTP URL, e.g.:

.IP
.EX
smtp[s]://[user[:pass]@]host[:port]

.EE
.IP
where "[...]" denotes an optional part.
Setting this variable overrides the value of the $sendmail

\(hy date
.TP
\(hy date\-received
.TP
\(hy from
.TP
\(hy score

\(hy to
.TP
\(hy unsorted
.RE
.PD 1
.IP
You may optionally use the "reverse\-" prefix to specify reverse sorting
order.
.IP
The "date\-sent" value is a synonym for "date". The "mailbox\-order" value is
a synonym for "unsorted".
.IP
Example:

.IP
.EX
set sort=reverse\-date\-sent

.EE


.TP
.B sort_alias
.nf
Type: sort order
Default: alias
.fi
.IP
Specifies how the entries in the "alias" menu are sorted.  The
following are legal values:
.RS
.PD 0
.TP
\(hy address (sort alphabetically by email address)
.TP
\(hy alias (sort alphabetically by alias name)
.TP
\(hy unsorted (leave in order specified in .neomuttrc)
.RE
.PD 1
.IP
Note: This also affects the entries of the address query menu, thus
potentially overruling the order of entries as generated by $query_command.


.TP
.B sort_aux
.nf
Type: sort order
Default: date
.fi
.IP
This provides a secondary sort for messages in the "index" menu, used
when the $sort value is equal for two messages.
.IP
When sorting by threads, this variable controls how threads are sorted
in relation to other threads, and how the branches of the thread trees
are sorted.  This can be set to any value that $sort can, except
"threads" (in that case, NeoMutt will just use "date").  You can also
specify the "last\-" prefix in addition to the "reverse\-" prefix, but "last\-"
must come after "reverse\-".  The "last\-" prefix causes messages to be
sorted against its siblings by which has the last descendant, using
the rest of $sort_aux as an ordering.  For instance,

.IP
.EX
set sort_aux=last\-date\-received

.EE
.IP
would mean that if a new message is received in a
thread, that thread becomes the last one displayed (or the first, if
you have "\fCset sort=reverse\-threads\fP".)
.IP
Note: For reversed\-threads $sort
order, $sort_aux is reversed again (which is not the right thing to do,
but kept to not break any existing configuration setting).


.TP
.B sort_browser

.RE
.PD 1
.IP
You may optionally use the "reverse\-" prefix to specify reverse sorting
order (example: "\fCset sort_browser=reverse\-date\fP").
.IP
The "unread" value is a synonym for "new".


.TP
.B sort_re
.nf
Type: boolean
Default: yes
.fi
.IP
This variable is only useful when sorting by threads with
$strict_threads \fIunset\fP.  In that case, it changes the heuristic
mutt uses to thread messages by subject.  With $sort_re \fIset\fP, mutt will
only attach a message as the child of another message by subject if
the subject of the child message starts with a substring matching the
setting of $reply_regex.  With $sort_re \fIunset\fP, mutt will attach
the message whether or not this is the case, as long as the
non\-$reply_regex parts of both messages are identical.


.TP
.B spam_separator
.nf
Type: string
Default: ","
.fi
.IP
This variable controls what happens when multiple spam headers
are matched: if \fIunset\fP, each successive header will overwrite any
previous matches value for the spam label. If \fIset\fP, each successive
match will append to the previous, using this variable's value as a
separator.


.TP
.B spoolfile
.nf
Type: mailbox
Default: ""
.fi
.IP
If your spool mailbox is in a non\-default place where NeoMutt can't find
it, you can specify its location with this variable. The description from
"named\-mailboxes" or "virtual\-mailboxes" may be used for the spoolfile.
.IP
If not specified, then the environment variables \fC$MAIL\fP and
\fC$MAILDIR\fP will be checked.


.TP
.B ssl_ca_certificates_file
.nf
Type: path
Default: ""

.IP
This variable specifies a file containing trusted CA certificates.
Any server certificate that is signed with one of these CA
certificates is also automatically accepted. (GnuTLS only)

.TP
.B ssl_force_tls
.nf
Type: boolean
Default: no
.fi
.IP
If this variable is \fIset\fP, NeoMutt will require that all connections
to remote servers be encrypted. Furthermore it will attempt to
negotiate TLS even if the server does not advertise the capability,
since it would otherwise have to abort the connection anyway. This
option supersedes $ssl_starttls.


.TP
.B ssl_min_dh_prime_bits
.nf
Type: number
Default: 0
.fi
.IP
This variable specifies the minimum acceptable prime size (in bits)
for use in any Diffie\-Hellman key exchange. A value of 0 will use
the default from the GNUTLS library. (GnuTLS only)


.TP
.B ssl_starttls
.nf
Type: quadoption
Default: yes
.fi
.IP
If \fIset\fP (the default), NeoMutt will attempt to use \fCSTARTTLS\fP on servers
advertising the capability. When \fIunset\fP, NeoMutt will not attempt to
use \fCSTARTTLS\fP regardless of the server's capabilities.
.IP
\fBNote\fP that \fCSTARTTLS\fP is subject to many kinds of

.IP
* = can be optionally printed if nonzero
.IP
Some of the above sequences can be used to optionally print a string
if their value is nonzero.  For example, you may only want to see the
number of flagged messages if such messages exist, since zero is not
particularly meaningful.  To optionally print a string based upon one
of the above sequences, the following construct is used:
.IP
\fC%?<sequence_char>?<optional_string>?\fP
.IP
where \fIsequence_char\fP is a character from the table above, and
\fIoptional_string\fP is the string you would like printed if
\fIsequence_char\fP is nonzero.  \fIoptional_string\fP \fBmay\fP contain
other sequences as well as normal text, but you may \fBnot\fP nest
optional strings.
.IP
Here is an example illustrating how to optionally print the number of
new messages in a mailbox:
.IP
\fC%?n?%n new messages.?\fP
.IP
You can also switch between two strings using the following construct:
.IP
\fC%?<sequence_char>?<if_string>&<else_string>?\fP
.IP
If the value of \fIsequence_char\fP is non\-zero, \fIif_string\fP will
be expanded, otherwise \fIelse_string\fP will be expanded.
.IP
You can force the result of any \fCprintf(3)\fP\-like sequence to be lowercase
by prefixing the sequence character with an underscore ("_") sign.
For example, if you want to display the local hostname in lowercase,
you would use: "\fC%_h\fP".
.IP
If you prefix the sequence character with a colon (":") character, NeoMutt
will replace any dots in the expansion by underscores. This might be helpful
with IMAP folders that don't like dots in folder names.


.TP
.B status_on_top
.nf
Type: boolean
Default: no
.fi
.IP
Setting this variable causes the "status bar" to be displayed on
the first line of the screen rather than near the bottom. If $help
is \fIset\fP, too it'll be placed at the bottom.


.TP
.B strict_threads
.nf
Type: boolean
Default: no
.fi
.IP
If \fIset\fP, threading will only make use of the "In\-Reply\-To" and
"References:" fields when you $sort by message threads.  By
default, messages with the same subject are grouped together in
"pseudo threads.". This may not always be desirable, such as in a
personal mailbox where you might have several unrelated messages with
the subjects like "hi" which will get grouped together. See also
$sort_re for a less drastic way of controlling this
behavior.


.TP
.B suspend
.nf
Type: boolean
Default: yes
.fi
.IP
When \fIunset\fP, NeoMutt won't stop when the user presses the terminal's
\fIsusp\fP key, usually "^Z". This is useful if you run NeoMutt
inside an xterm using a command like "\fCxterm \-e neomutt\fP".


.TP
.B text_flowed
.nf
Type: boolean
Default: no
.fi
.IP
When \fIset\fP, NeoMutt will generate "format=flowed" bodies with a content type
of "\fCtext/plain; format=flowed\fP".
This format is easier to handle for some mailing software, and generally
just looks like ordinary text.  To actually make use of this format's
features, you'll need support in your editor.
.IP
The option only controls newly composed messages.  Postponed messages,
resent messages, and draft messages (via \-H on the command line) will
use the content\-type of the source message.
.IP
Note that $indent_string is ignored when this option is \fIset\fP.


.TP
.B thorough_search
.nf
Type: boolean
Default: yes
.fi
.IP
Affects the \fC~b\fP and \fC~h\fP search operations described in
section "patterns".  If \fIset\fP, the headers and body/attachments of
messages to be searched are decoded before searching. If \fIunset\fP,
messages are searched as they appear in the folder.
.IP
Users searching attachments or for non\-ASCII characters should \fIset\fP
this value because decoding also includes MIME parsing/decoding and possible
character set conversions. Otherwise NeoMutt will attempt to match against the
raw message received (for example quoted\-printable encoded or with encoded
headers) which may lead to incorrect search results.


.TP
.B thread_received
.nf
Type: boolean
Default: no
.fi
.IP
When \fIset\fP, NeoMutt uses the date received rather than the date sent
to thread messages by subject.


.TP
.B tilde
.nf
Type: boolean
Default: no
.fi
.IP
When \fIset\fP, the internal\-pager will pad blank lines to the bottom of the
screen with a tilde ("~").


.TP
.B time_inc
.nf
Type: number
Default: 0
.fi
.IP
Along with $read_inc, $write_inc, and $net_inc, this
variable controls the frequency with which progress updates are
displayed. It suppresses updates less than $time_inc milliseconds
apart. This can improve throughput on systems with slow terminals,
or when running NeoMutt on a remote system.
.IP
Also see the "tuning" section of the manual for performance considerations.


.TP
.B timeout
.nf
Type: number
Default: 600
.fi
.IP
When NeoMutt is waiting for user input either idling in menus or
in an interactive prompt, NeoMutt would block until input is
present. Depending on the context, this would prevent certain
operations from working, like checking for new mail or keeping
an IMAP connection alive.
.IP
This variable controls how many seconds NeoMutt will at most wait
until it aborts waiting for input, performs these operations and
continues to wait for input.
.IP
A value of zero or less will cause NeoMutt to never time out.


.TP
.B tmpdir
.nf
Type: path
Default: "/tmp"
.fi
.IP
This variable allows you to specify where NeoMutt will place its
temporary files needed for displaying and composing messages.
.IP
If this variable is not set, the environment variable \fC$TMPDIR\fP is
used.  Failing that, then "\fC/tmp\fP" is used.


.TP
.B to_chars
.nf
Type: character string
Default: " +TCFLR"
.fi
.IP
Controls the character used to indicate mail addressed to you.

.TP
.B toggle_quoted_show_levels
.nf
Type: number
Default: 0
.fi
.IP
Quoted text may be filtered out using the \fC<toggle\-quoted>\fP command.
If set to a number greater than 0, then the \fC<toggle\-quoted>\fP
command will only filter out quote levels above this number.


.TP
.B trash
.nf
Type: mailbox
Default: ""
.fi
.IP
If set, this variable specifies the path of the trash folder where the
mails marked for deletion will be moved, instead of being irremediably
purged.
.IP
NOTE: When you delete a message in the trash folder, it is really
deleted, so that you have a way to clean the trash.


.TP
.B ts_enabled
.nf
Type: boolean
Default: no
.fi
.IP
Controls whether NeoMutt tries to set the terminal status line and icon name.
Most terminal emulators emulate the status line in the window title.


.TP
.B ts_icon_format
.nf
Type: string
Default: "M%?n?AIL&ail?"
.fi
.IP
Controls the format of the icon title, as long as "$ts_enabled" is set.
This string is identical in formatting to the one used by
"$status_format".


.TP
.B ts_status_format
.nf
Type: string
Default: "NeoMutt with %?m?%m messages&no messages?%?n? [%n NEW]?"
.fi
.IP
Controls the format of the terminal status line (or window title),
provided that "$ts_enabled" has been set. This string is identical in
formatting to the one used by "$status_format".


.TP
.B tunnel
.nf
Type: command
Default: ""
.fi
.IP
Setting this variable will cause NeoMutt to open a pipe to a command
instead of a raw socket. You may be able to use this to set up
preauthenticated connections to your IMAP/POP3/SMTP server. Example:

.IP
.EX
set tunnel="ssh \-q mailhost.net /usr/local/libexec/imapd"

.EE
.IP
Note: For this example to work you must be able to log in to the remote
machine without having to enter a password.
.IP
When set, NeoMutt uses the tunnel for all remote connections.
Please see "account-hook" in the manual for how to use different
tunnel commands per connection.


.TP
.B tunnel_is_secure
.nf
Type: boolean
Default: yes
.fi
.IP
When \fIset\fP, NeoMutt will assume the $tunnel connection does not need
STARTTLS to be enabled.  It will also allow IMAP PREAUTH server
responses inside a tunnel to proceed.  This is appropriate if $tunnel
uses ssh or directly invokes the server locally.
.IP
When \fIunset\fP, NeoMutt will negotiate STARTTLS according to the
ssl_starttls and ssl_force_tls variables.  If ssl_force_tls is
set, NeoMutt will abort connecting if an IMAP server responds with PREAUTH.
This setting is appropriate if $tunnel does not provide security and
could be tampered with by attackers.


.TP
.B uncollapse_jump
.nf
Type: boolean
Default: no
.fi
.IP
When \fIset\fP, NeoMutt will jump to the next unread message, if any,
when the current thread is \fIun\fPcollapsed.


.TP
.B uncollapse_new
.nf
Type: boolean
Default: yes
.fi
.IP
When \fIset\fP, NeoMutt will automatically uncollapse any collapsed thread
that receives a new message. When \fIunset\fP, collapsed threads will
remain collapsed. the presence of the new message will still affect
index sorting, though.


.TP
.B use_8bitmime
.nf
Type: boolean
Default: no
.fi
.IP
\fBWarning:\fP do not set this variable unless you are using a version
of sendmail which supports the \fC\-B8BITMIME\fP flag (such as sendmail
8.8.x) or you may not be able to send mail.
.IP
When \fIset\fP, NeoMutt will invoke $sendmail with the \fC\-B8BITMIME\fP
flag when sending 8\-bit messages to enable ESMTP negotiation.


.TP
.B use_domain
.nf
Type: boolean
Default: yes
.fi
.IP
When \fIset\fP, NeoMutt will qualify all local addresses (ones without the
"@host" portion) with the value of $hostname.  If \fIunset\fP, no
addresses will be qualified.


.TP
.B use_envelope_from
.nf
Type: boolean
Default: no
.fi
.IP
When \fIset\fP, NeoMutt will set the \fIenvelope\fP sender of the message.
If $envelope_from_address is \fIset\fP, it will be used as the sender
address. If \fIunset\fP, NeoMutt will attempt to derive the sender from the
"From:" header.
.IP
Note that this information is passed to sendmail command using the
\fC\-f\fP command line switch. Therefore setting this option is not useful
if the $sendmail variable already contains \fC\-f\fP or if the
executable pointed to by $sendmail doesn't support the \fC\-f\fP switch.


.TP
.B use_from
.nf
Type: boolean
Default: yes
.fi
.IP
When \fIset\fP, NeoMutt will generate the "From:" header field when
sending messages.  If \fIunset\fP, no "From:" header field will be
generated unless the user explicitly sets one using the "my_hdr"
command.


.TP
.B use_ipv6
.nf
Type: boolean
Default: yes
.fi
.IP
When \fIset\fP, NeoMutt will look for IPv6 addresses of hosts it tries to
contact.  If this option is \fIunset\fP, NeoMutt will restrict itself to IPv4 addresses.
Normally, the default should work.


.TP
.B user_agent
.nf
Type: boolean
Default: no
.fi
.IP
When \fIset\fP, NeoMutt will add a "User\-Agent:" header to outgoing
messages, indicating which version of NeoMutt was used for composing
them.


.TP
.B vfolder_format
.nf
Type: string
Default: "%2C %?n?%4n/&     ?%4m %f"
.fi
.IP
This variable allows you to customize the file browser display for virtual
folders to your personal taste.  This string uses many of the same
expandos as $folder_format.


.TP
.B virtual_spoolfile
.nf
Type: boolean
Default: no
.fi
.IP
When \fIset\fP, NeoMutt will use the first defined virtual mailbox (see
virtual\-mailboxes) as a spool file.
.IP
This command is now unnecessary. $spoolfile has been extended to support
mailbox descriptions as a value.


.TP
.B visual
.nf
Type: command
Default: "vi"
.fi
.IP
Specifies the visual editor to invoke when the "\fC~v\fP" command is
given in the built\-in editor.
.IP
$visual is overridden by the environment variable \fC$VISUAL\fP or \fC$EDITOR\fP.


.TP
.B wait_key
.nf
Type: boolean
Default: yes
.fi
.IP
Controls whether NeoMutt will ask you to press a key after an external command
has been invoked by these functions: \fC<shell\-escape>\fP,
\fC<pipe\-message>\fP, \fC<pipe\-entry>\fP, \fC<print\-message>\fP,
and \fC<print\-entry>\fP commands.
.IP
It is also used when viewing attachments with "auto_view", provided
that the corresponding mailcap entry has a \fIneedsterminal\fP flag,
and the external program is interactive.
.IP
When \fIset\fP, NeoMutt will always ask for a key. When \fIunset\fP, NeoMutt will wait
for a key only if the external command returned a non\-zero status.


.TP
.B weed
.nf
Type: boolean
Default: yes
.fi
.IP
When \fIset\fP, NeoMutt will weed headers when displaying, forwarding,
or replying to messages.
.IP
Also see $copy_decode_weed, $pipe_decode_weed, $print_decode_weed.


.TP
.B wrap
.nf
Type: number
Default: 0
.fi
.IP
When set to a positive value, NeoMutt will wrap text at $wrap characters.
When set to a negative value, NeoMutt will wrap text so that there are $wrap
characters of empty space on the right side of the terminal. Setting it
to zero makes NeoMutt wrap at the terminal width.
.IP
Also see $reflow_wrap.


.TP
.B wrap_headers
.nf
Type: number
Default: 78
.fi
.IP
This option specifies the number of characters to use for wrapping
an outgoing message's headers. Allowed values are between 78 and 998
inclusive.
.IP
\fBNote:\fP This option usually shouldn't be changed. RFC5233
recommends a line length of 78 (the default), so \fBplease only change
this setting when you know what you're doing\fP.


.TP
.B wrap_search
.nf
Type: boolean
Default: yes
.fi
.IP
Controls whether searches wrap around the end.
.IP
When \fIset\fP, searches will wrap around the first (or last) item. When
\fIunset\fP, incremental searches will not wrap.


.TP
.B write_bcc
.nf
Type: boolean
Default: no
.fi
.IP
Controls whether NeoMutt writes out the "Bcc:" header when
preparing messages to be sent.  Some MTAs, such as Exim and
Courier, do not strip the "Bcc:" header; so it is advisable to
leave this unset unless you have a particular need for the header
to be in the sent message.
.IP
If NeoMutt is set to deliver directly via SMTP(see $smtp_url),
this option does nothing: NeoMutt will never write out the "Bcc:"
header in this case.
.IP
Note this option only affects the sending of messages.  Fcc'ed
copies of a message will always contain the "Bcc:" header if
one exists.


.TP
.B write_inc
.nf
Type: number
Default: 10
.fi
.IP
When writing a mailbox, a message will be printed every
$write_inc messages to indicate progress.  If set to 0, only a
single message will be displayed before writing a mailbox.
.IP
Also see the $read_inc, $net_inc and $time_inc variables and the
"tuning" section of the manual for performance considerations.


.TP
.B x_comment_to
.nf
Type: boolean
Default: no
.fi
.IP
If \fIset\fP, NeoMutt will add "X\-Comment\-To:" field (that contains full
name of original article author) to article that followuped to newsgroup.
